Copyright has never been and never will be an obstacle to technical progress and this has been the case since printing was first developed
On the other hand without serious protection technical development can undermine copyright and as a result stymie creation
In my opinion the system proposed by the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens Rights in the area of digital private copying is a good one because before any technical measures are developed to protect the rightholders there will be a financial contribution and fair remuneration probably as is currently done with the analogue equivalent
In conclusion our job is not just to organise a technological free competition and free trade area
It is also our job as Mr Rothley said to maintain and develop cultural creation in Europe in all its diversity
This directive as amended generalises and thus confirms the European copyright model without preventing works from being disseminated
For this reason I together with part of the ELDR Group will vote in favour of Mr Barzanti report
Mr President the Commission proposal and the report both pinpoint the flaws that exist in the Union legislative procedures
An international panel of experts should have been appointed to investigate thoroughly the complex problems associated with copyright and public access
There should have been a broad public discussion before the legislative process was embarked upon
Instead we now have a legal text that is obscure and not sufficiently businesslike
Nor does a surfeit of words make the legislation any clearer
In particular we regret the lack of clarity in defining the position as regards the provisions that exist in the Nordic countries whereby ordinary people are entitled to have access to official documents and information
What is most needed in this as well as in other areas is a serious in-depth analysis of the problems
Mr President Tony Blair once said that his country culture industry is a greater source of revenue than the steel industry But digital technology has now opened up a whole new dimension for pirating
It is estimated that about one million CDS are stolen from the Internet every day
It is therefore high time that we introduced legislation not just for music but for all kinds of audio-visual material
We must ensure that the author or copyright holder is granted exclusive rights to the reproduction distribution or any communication of his work to the public
That is the only way to create a favourable environment which can stimulate creativity and investment
Effective cross-border protection of intellectual property offers many benefits
In economic terms it will ensure an expanded market which in social terms will create more job opportunities and last but not least there is the cultural dimension
Consumers must continue to have the guarantee of good quality and let us not forget creativity and artistic innovation are the source of income for authors
In order to continue to preserve and further enrich our artistic identity our artists must be further encouraged
Above all we must take care of young talents who are busy creating what in future may be much loved but unprotected
People are looking to us to provide effective regulation including on behalf of those who are not yet famous
It is up to us as the European legislator to guarantee this
For this reason I shall be voting for Mr Barzanti report on which I congratulate him
Mr President the directive is on three levels namely technical legal and political which adds considerably to its complexity
Both the committee and the rapporteur Mr Barzanti have nevertheless done an excellent job
However I would urge the House to vote against Amendment No which calls for a non-voluntary licence or legal presumption
The Nordic countries have had licensing and collective agreements for a long time and the experience has been constructive
The agreements also extend to authors who remain outside the organisations responsible for concluding the agreements and guarantee rights and levels of remuneration
It is essential that such a system which benefits all the parties concerned should be retained and not replaced by a non-voluntary licensing arrangement
To do so would contravene both the Berne and WIPO Conventions
This is basically a cultural issue but there is also the question of safeguarding the rights of public institutions such as hospitals schools libraries museums archives prisons and last but not least both the rights and opportunities of the disabled
Free and equal access to information culture and public documents is essential for the democratic development of society
It is essential that this is guaranteed by the directive
Mr President I would like to thank the rapporteur for his good humour and fortitude in tackling this difficult report difficult firstly because it needs to strike a balance between the rights of the authors and the needs of consumers and secondly because technology is changing rapidly which makes it hard to anticipate legislative problems in such a context
I want to pinpoint three issues disability rights the need to be able to report parliamentary and judicial proceedings and the issue of fair compensation
On the disability rights issue I have tabled an amendment for the British Labour Group which is preferred by the disability lobby because it is mandatory rather than optional like the amendment adopted by the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens Rights
Philip Whitehead and I have also tabled an amendment to allow fair reporting of parliamentary and judicial proceedings
The issue of fair compensation and I speak for the British Labour members poses a problem for the United Kingdom
Although the exceptions are optional and can be adapted to national law at the will of the Member States the amendments as they stand at present would introduce the obligation to introduce fair compensation
In Britain people have got used to copying their favourite TV programme and watching it at leisure at the time most convenient for them
This is a right which does not incur financial consequences
The British public would be extremely unhappy if this right was curtailed by having to make a payment
Therefore my Group cannot accept that concept
Mr President copyright is not merely restricted to the question of who is due compensation and how it may be most effectively collected
Mr Barzanti report should basically be concerned with the principles of the free development of the information network and its commercial exploitation in other words enabling the consumer to use the Internet at the lowest possible cost to him or her
The protection of copyright is in everyone interest but not necessarily on the terms of those who up to now have been in the strongest position
It is a matter of setting priorities greater rights for the holder or the freedoms of the Internet user and the right of the Internet service provider to operate
As far as the future of the information society is concerned the latter objective is the more crucial one
The report basic theme that digital copyright may be best protected by prohibiting the temporary reproduction of material for transmission is completely at odds with the widely accepted principles associated with operating the Internet
If the prohibition of temporary reproduction is allowed to go through and technological monopolies spring up such practices as surfing the Internet could be forbidden and an ordinary computer could be regarded as an illicit piece of equipment used to dodge copyright protection
One of Mr Barzanti main objectives is to improve the conditions under which European copyright holders can get their work published
However over % of the market in the sales of music products in Europe is now in non-European hands
Tightening up on electronic copyright would further concentrate business in the mega-companies of Hollywood
This contrary to the opinion of the Committee on Culture Youth Education and the Media in particular would not improve conditions for European artists to get their work published and sold
Mr President safeguarding copyright in the world of the digital information network is a crucially important objective
Illegal reproduction threatens the legitimate interests of copyright holders and ultimately the production of content in its entirety as well as the profitability of creative work
However the public right to information is just as legitimate and important as is the development of an information society available to all
In many Member States a viable copyright environment has been successfully created one that safeguards a balance between a flexible approach to the use of material and the interests of rightholders
The EU copyright directive and especially the more stringent version proposed by the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens Rights is a threat to this balance
In its present form the directive would significantly restrict the free circulation of information and the ability of public service institutions to provide citizens with a service
The copyright balance also requires provision to be made for minimum compulsory exemptions connected with access to information study and research to act as a counterweight to strong harmonised protection of copyright such exemptions have already been acknowledged and ratified in all international agreements in this sector
In addition to compulsory exemption we must be able to create codes of practice to be applied nationally on the basis of local tradition and culture for example in collective bargaining agreements
The consequences of library services being solely dependent on licences being granted or not by rightholders as the proposal for a directive suggests will be particularly disastrous
The right to information must not be subject to licence in the lifelong learning society while distance learning and virtual network services are becoming ever more common
We certainly do not want to take a step backwards and have a situation where electronic material cannot be seen browsed or reproduced without a separate licence or charge
In the democratic information society it is appropriate to safeguard the practice of reproducing material for purposes of study research or private use particularly via libraries as libraries archives and museums have an obligation to guarantee that materials connected with matters of culture and heritage are preserved and accessible in electronic form also
Mr President many thanks to Mr Barzanti
He has balanced diverse interests very well
Quite simply intellectual creation is vital to the future of our economy but it is also the lifeblood of our society be it music film photographs books or software
We are told we must balance interests but quite frankly all interests are not equal
Large telecoms companies will always survive but if we strangle and silence individual creators we will never win them back
Blank screens will not enrich our society
We have to ensure creators enjoy sufficient incentive and reward for their work
A strong system of copyright as proposed by the Commission and Mr Barzanti will ensure dignity independence and survival for creators
Too many continue to scrape together a living in a kind of La Bohème garret
Only % of authors in France earn above the minimum wage Let us never forget that
I have friends who are authors and they survive hand-to-mouth on royalties and have to sell their own belongings to write the next book or create the next film
I can therefore never support an amendment providing for the forced transfer of rights away from authors to others
It is absolutely critical to have exemptions for the disabled education research archives investigative journalism and libraries
Some would argue that there should be fair use without fair compensation
Why do we demand of authors and artists what we do not demand of other workers in our economy
Systems of fair compensation through a blank tape levy exist in out of the countries
All the UK creators and their trade unions support a blank tape levy
All I am saying to British Members of this House is do not vote against Amendments Nos and 
Allow the creators and others in the United Kingdom to have a fair debate about whether we should have a blank tape levy
Let me make it clear that these are not obligatory exemptions
Voting for those amendments will not force the British Government to introduce a blank tape levy
Let us ensure that out of this we have a cultural rainforest in the words of our great author Maureen Duffy
Mr President in my opinion the report drawn up by Mr Barzanti is a very balanced document
Whenever the paths cross of those who own intellectual property rights and those who have access to the information there is a conflict
I believe that the property issue is a fundamental one and that this is not a question of how the information is disseminated
For this reason I believe that the principles Mr Barzanti has identified and incorporated into his report are the right ones
Obviously exceptions are needed but they should be limited and should uphold the rules on the protection of intellectual property
I will soon have served as a Member of Parliament both at national level and here for years and in all that time I have never before been lobbied so intensively on an issue by the interest groups
When it comes to the vote I hope that this Parliament will not help the new forms of media which have a role to play and should be able to do so to strike it rich at the expense of authors
Mr President Commissioner ladies and gentlemen there are three branches of industry which have an interest in seeing a strong and clear copyright directive namely the content industry the telecommunication and service providers and suppliers of consumer electronics
Then there are also of course our consumers libraries schools etc to be considered
The Barzanti report clearly weights the balance in favour of the content industry at the expense of the other branches of industry and especially the consumers
Copyright holders are given an absolute right to protection with the banning of copying for private use for example
American companies are now trying to lobby for legislation in Europe to go much further than in the United States where such an absolute right has just been forcefully rejected
US companies are therefore deliberately placing Europe at a disadvantage and Europe will be accepting this if we accept the Barzanti report
We will be falling behind especially our industry and this will cost jobs
It is primarily the Committee on Legal Affairs which is now busy fighting a rearguard action because with this directive the established industry is trying to maintain its present market position in the old media at the expense of the new
New technological developments such as the Internet will be held back by the directive and artists manipulated and made to dance to industry tune with big names such as Claudia Cardinale being brought in
But the new generation of artists who are distributing their products on the Internet are being left out in the cold
Finally I have a question for Commissioner Monti
How does the copyright directive stand in relation to the proposal for a directive for electronic commerce
In other words if there is a difference in copyright protection between the Member States which applies The principle of the country of origin or the country of destination
In the directive on electronic commerce we now have before us the basis is the country of origin
It may seem that the common agricultural policy or the trans-European transport network are higher priorities but they are not
European copyright policy also relates to food and transport It concerns the production and distribution of books and newspapers of music and of audio-visual and multimedia products
If these products are in short supply or of inferior quality that will sound the death-knell for Europe
European society will be unable to assert its differentness will lose its vitality and will fail to balance its trade unless it can claim that share of the cultural market that is its by right
With the advent of the Internet and digitalisation and whatever other unknown technologies are around the corner along with globalisation of the market enlargement of the Union and the increasing role of multilateral treaties a policy on copyright is a priority for Europe
That is because creators and artists act as our antennae for the future as our critical conscience and as our calling card
It is therefore in all our interests that they should thrive
So what is involved
Basically facilitating the distribution of creative work rewarding everyone taking part in that process creators and investors alike and eliminating piracy
What ought to be done
We should set up a permanent body to help the Member States negotiate guarantee the international compatibility of European legislation and make sure it is constantly updated We should also automate remuneration systems as far as possible and increase the use of protection technologies
The Barzanti report is an excellent one because it not only adopts a cultural perspective but it is also an appeal for the key words to be compatibility and harmonisation
That is after all the only way of defending the interests at stake All parties Member States and artists producers and users have to be shown that they are in the same boat and need to row in time and row hard if they are to reach a safe harbour
Mr President in today proposal on copyright we are rightly concerned to protect authors and performers but also record and phonogram producers who must be properly remunerated
At this point however the House is being asked to approve legislation which limits the right of European operators to have access to the Internet in contrast to what has been provided in the recent World Intellectual Property Organisation treaty and the US Digital Millennium Copyright Act
This is rightly being done to protect copyright but under pressure from the big multinational record companies which are now all American if not by origin then at least in terms of their economic interests
The Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens Rights has required technical copies to be authorised but I do not see how that can strengthen copyright
Copyright is in fact already substantially protected by Article of the directive which establishes the principle whereby no one may place works on the networks without the permission of the copyright holder
How will that further authorisation improve the position of authors
That is not the way to combat piracy at least according to the US legislation which takes the view that the procedures for identifying and closing suspect sites provide the most effective way of combating that particular scourge
If network operators were required to monitor all of the packages sent by service suppliers numbers would have to be reduced leaving them concentrated in just a few hands
That is not what the independent record industry in Europe wants that same industry which is investing in most of the recordings made in Europe which is creating jobs and development believes in young artists and is exporting Europe musical products to the outside world
It is those with interests on the other side of the Atlantic that want it
The people who are asking us to close off access to the Internet are importing into Europe music produced elsewhere
Even the small proportion of music produced in Europe is adopting commercial standards that require mass sales which are in turn dependent on the kind of hugely costly advertising campaigns that the Italian supervisory body recently condemned in Italy in its decision against the Big Five that is to say the five big music companies
Let me end by pointing out that the independent record industry and the managers the artists true representatives are asking us to call a halt before it is too late
I propose to accept their advice and vote for the Cassidy and Thors amendments which come closer to meeting the needs of artists
In that way we shall be able genuinely to protect the future of the information society of music and of consumers
Mr President Mr Barzanti report is an important one and he has demonstrated some artistry in putting it together
It is true that this is only the first reading and we can correct many of its possible shortcomings if any emerge later on
However I would like to point out that a good balance has been achieved in many Member States by virtue of agreements made without any directive whatsoever as for example in my own country
Three issues are at odds with each other first there is the public right to information which means libraries lifelong learning and so on
That cannot be violated it is a vital principle
Secondly most important is the right of creative people to their intellectual property
Thirdly we must create and maintain a viable context for the electronic market as it is an area that employs a lot of people in Europe
We have to be able to make these three issues compatible
We all believe that piracy is a crime and we have to oppose it
For that reason I believe we should look at the next stage of the directive after voting
We need to discuss the work of the rightholder on the one hand and industry on the other from the employment point of view to achieve the best possible European employment model in relation to copyright and industry with regard to radio television and other electronic media
At present we seem to be squabbling quite a lot among ourselves and employment and material in Europe are suffering as a result yet both these issues are now among our most crucial concerns as they represent European identity culture and jobs
Mr President as this debate draws to a close I should like to refer to an oft-neglected matter namely certain recitals
I said earlier that this report set a political course although it was technically imperfect
There are some very clear examples of this in the recitals
Some of the recitals do not correspond to any of the amendments to the main body of the text and are therefore technically unacceptable but they outline three clear political ways forward
Mr Barzanti mentioned the first of these which concerns indigenous peoples and their cultural rights
The second referred to by Mr Perry suggests that the WIPO has made a determined effort to promote mediation as a solution to disputes
The Group of the European People Party will support two amendments to recital to that effect that is Amendments Nos and if I remember correctly
The final political direction concerned an issue that I should like to consider in greater detail as it has been somewhat sidelined even though it was the subject of heated debate
Despite being related to another important directive under discussion at the moment the directive on electronic commerce and also to a directive on responsibility in a general sense this directive has its own distinctive features
The usual procedures should be followed and it should be approved as soon as possible
An amendment has however been tabled and it is supported by the Group of the European People Party emphasising in effect that though all these directives have their own distinctive features they should be handled in parallel and implemented at the earliest opportunity
Finally I have to say that I was delighted to hear such an authority as Mrs Mann sound a note of reason with regard to what is often portrayed as the entrenched rivalry between European and American industry
I fully endorse her views
I believe that this is a balanced directive
It will need to be improved at second reading but it sends a clear political signal
The ball is now in the Commission court
Mr President Italian companies account for % of original European production but the big multinationals take up % of the market by importing products from outside Europe in particular from the USA
At one time almost all Europe major hits came into being with the help of a producer who believed in them
Only later because of distribution needs did they have to approach a multinational
That is why our approach to the directive differs from that of the big multinational record companies which have established a stranglehold on distribution and advertising because they control all the systems for access to stores the media and the charts
We feel that the Internet provides an effective way of avoiding that stranglehold
What is really at stake here is not protecting copyright that is already guaranteed by Article of the directive but maintaining the current state of freedom of access to the Internet for everyone and not just the big boys
The requirement for technical copies to be authorised adopted by the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens Rights would actually have the effect of extending to the digital sphere the dominance which the multinationals already enjoy over the way in which music is conventionally distributed
We therefore take the view that it is necessary to redraft Article to avoid limiting de facto access to the networks for independent operators
Furthermore we believe it necessary to encourage the investments of independent access providers who are the natural partners of independent music producers in Europe
The reality is that European producers primarily need unrestricted and low-cost access to the networks in order to be able to offer the kind of music which the big multinationals regard as uneconomical in terms of their own commercial criteria
In offering their product on the Internet the companies also need to use systems compatible with the interfaces most commonly used by consumers as they cannot run the risk of investing in websites that might subsequently prove incompatible with the new versions of dominant software
Secondly European producers need programmes of support similar to those through which the audiovisual sector is supported via the media
Finally they need strategic research and development programmes that will allow the European music industry and the European technology industry to establish by common accord standards for the secure and effective distribution of music as an alternative to the American analogue standards
For all of these reasons the non-attached Members believe that it is right to reassess the situation and are therefore calling for the directive to be referred back to committee
Mr President creative and innovative activities will be critical to the development of the information society
This proposal for a directive is an important part of the legislative framework which is currently being drawn up at both a European and a global level to guarantee harmonious development of the information society
The information society is in fact evolving in a global context
In the international community adopted two treaties under the auspices of WIPO one on copyright and the other on interpretation and performance and on phonograms
I would remind the House that the European Union played a vital role in the drafting of those treaties
It can now accede to them as the European Community and be among the first to ratify them
The United States has already met its requirements
Thirty instruments of ratification will have to be deposited before the treaties enter into force
The European Union accounts for because of the agreements that link it to the countries of the European Economic Area and the countries of Central and Eastern Europe and the fact that it has association agreements with still more countries
Ratification of the treaties by the Union and its Member States is based on their incorporation into the national legal systems it is their incorporation into Community law that is among other things the objective of this proposal
Alongside meeting our international commitments the basic aim of the proposal is to put in place a harmonised legislative framework for copyright and related rights
We expect that greater legal certainty guaranteeing investment in creative and innovative activity and in the network infrastructures will boost growth and the competitiveness of the European industry and job creation
It is for us to tap this huge cultural and economic potential by providing the appropriate legislative framework
In drafting and adopting this proposal which as you will remember is the product of wide-ranging consultation dating back to the Commission has taken the greatest care to retain a fair balance between the various rights and interests at issue which are frequently in open conflict
I am well aware that this was also the aim of Parliament work
On behalf of the Commission I wish to thank the rapporteur Mr Barzanti for having done his job so efficiently
He has managed to combine a thorough understanding of the problem founded also on the earlier work on the Green Paper and the communication with the great resolve that tackling such sensitive proposals demands
Fifty-eight amendments have been tabled of which relate to the operative part of the text and to the recitals of those amendments the Commission is able to accept and to take into consideration but it has to reject 
The amendments the Commission is able to accept are the following Amendments Nos and 
The Commission will take into account the following amendments albeit with a number of mainly drafting changes Amendments Nos and the new Amendments Nos and 
As far as the recitals are concerned the Commission rejects Amendment No which in our view confuses protected work and information in general and is contrary to the principles of the acquis communautaire the first part of Amendment No which is incompatible with the WIPO treaty though we accept the second part
Amendment No which does not in our view succeed in defining the concept of public a responsibility we believe is best left to the Member States which are in a better position to define this somewhat elastic term
Amendment No which does not correspond to the amendments tabled in relation to Article b
Amendment No because it calls into question the approach taken in the proposal to the exceptions
Amendments Nos and which are already covered by the third recital and Amendments Nos and because they are too far outside the scope of the proposal
Turning then to the actual articles of the directive the Commission rejects Amendment No because the issue it tackles is taken into account in Article 
Amendments Nos and which are designed to introduce new exceptions for the benefit of broadcasters I wish to deal separately in just a moment with our rejection of Amendment No concerning Article Amendment No because the concern on which it is based is amply taken into account by Article c an amendment at your suggestion and Amendment No because that issue is being dealt with under the th recital amended by Amendment No 
As regards the amendments tabled at this part-session given that they either reflect viewpoints and concerns already taken into account in the report of the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens Rights or are amendments rejected by that committee the Commission endorses the report
Of the new amendments we are able to take into account only Nos and which relate to mediation a point mentioned by Mr Perry and taken up by Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi
Overall the Commission is thus able to take Parliament line on many points
I repeat we are rejecting amendments taking account of and accepting 
To conclude I have two points to make concerning two specific issues
As far as the broadcasters are concerned the House is proposing to add three new exceptions for their benefit
I would remind you of our interest in observing a balance between the rights and interests which are at stake
The Commission accepts Amendment No which introduces an exception for broadcasters in respect of specific acts of reproduction necessary to facilitate a legitimate broadcasting act because it meets a genuine technological need
In contrast and in an effort to achieve a balance between the interests in play the Commission feels compelled to reject Amendments Nos and the first of which introduces an exception that would allow broadcasters to make available on request programmes largely consisting of phonograms
We then come to Article the source of such controversy
What is the purpose of that provision
It is designed to establish an exception to the right of reproduction in regard to some technical acts of reproduction that are an integral part of a technological process carried out for the sole purpose of enabling a different use to be made of the protected material
This is the only mandatory exception in the whole of the proposal and it is therefore very clearly drafted
That provision will give the telecommunications operators and service providers the legal certainty they need to be able to perform operations for the benefit of the network services which are very often transnational in nature
We have subdivided your proposals on this and are able to take account of some
As far as the definition of the scope of the exceptions is concerned we are able to accept the inclusion of the words transient and incidental as providing a closer definition of the concept of temporary that appears in our proposal and of the word essential which further defines the incidental nature of the act in relation to the technical transmission process
Consequently we reject Amendments Nos and which have the effect of watering down the latter condition
We cannot however accept the concept of economic significance for the rightholder
The reference to our concept of independent economic significance is consistent with the aim of the exception and therefore workable when the exception is actually applied
It is in any event worth bearing in mind that protection against unjustified economic harm is provided for in Article 
Finally we cannot accept the insertion of the clause referring to uses authorised or permitted by law the addition of which would mean that the exception would be triggered only in relation to items whose use had been authorised by the rightholders or permitted by law
We are aware of the concerns of rightholders who fear that the network will end up acting as a broadcasting vehicle for items that have been illegally copied pirated items but if we are to hit our target we have to consider beforehand what is the most workable and balanced way of achieving it
In this case that way has to be sought by ensuring a proper balance between rights and exceptions to those rights
Finally I would draw your attention to a very important group of amendments those concerning private copies
Your amendments uphold two important principles the right of rightholders to fair remuneration and the fine distinction concerning private digital copies
The first principle protects a need for equity it is a measured step forwards in the quest for legal certainty in this sector
The Commission acceptance of the amendment relating to digital copies for private use must be seen in the context of the approach already set out in recitals and of our proposal
Specifically in the light of what is set out in those sections of the proposal the Commission agrees to recognise the principle that in the digital sphere the possibility of making a copy for private use must exist without prejudice to the effective and workable technical means that are capable of protecting the interests of rightholders
We therefore align ourselves with the solution you have put forward though the amendment will have to be redrafted in such a way as to provide an accurate statement of the principle
You link not only analogue and digital copies for private use but also the exceptions concerning illustration and teaching to the principle of fair remuneration for rightholders
That is a formula which allows broader harmonisation and respects the traditions and practices of the Member States
The Commission is able to follow Parliament line here too and therefore accepts Amendments Nos and as well as Amendments No and 
The protection of technological measures forms the subject-matter of Article of the proposal which has been substantially recast by your Amendments Nos and 
We are able to take those amendments into consideration subject to a degree of clarification which the Commission considers important
We congratulate Mr Barzanti on a comprehensive and determined piece of work
I welcome the fact that you support the Commission proposal in terms of both the overall approach and I think I can honestly say this the main components
In the past Parliament influence has been decisive in the adoption of the five directives already in force the cooperation that exists between Parliament and the Commission in the field of copyright and related rights is something we can rely on and for that I am truly grateful
Mr President I put a specific question about the compatibility of this amended copyright directive with the proposal for a directive on electronic commerce that the Commission made to the Parliament and the Council
In the proposal on electronic commerce the country of origin is the principal component In this copyright directive it could be the country of destination
That is why I asked my question and the Commisioner did not answer it
Mr President I am fully aware that I did not answer This was because of time constraints
However I shall now answer very briefly
The Commission submitted its proposal on the legal framework for electronic commerce last year
Both proposals are independent and each has its own crucial importance
According to the proposal on electronic commerce the country of origin principle does not apply to intellectual and industrial property in accordance with existing international law
The debate is closed
The vote will be taken tomorrow at noon
Common organisation of the market in wine
The next item is the report A by Mr P Martin on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development on the proposal for a Council Regulation EC on the common organisation of the market in wine CCNS
Mr President Commissioner ladies and gentlemen the common organisation of the market in wine is certainly the most complex of all the COMs because it includes not only aspects relating to vineyard management and conditions of grape production but also all rules concerning oenological practices the processing of wine as well as rules on labelling
The very structure of the text of the COM in wine shows us that wine is an agricultural product rather than an industrial product
In the time I have been allocated I am not going to present all of the amendments that are included in my report and that are the result of a vote in committee on almost amendments tabled by all Members
I would like at this stage of my presentation to thank firstly all the officials in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development and all those colleagues who made my task easier for me and enabled me to draw up a coherent report
What are the central themes of my report
Firstly a significant number of amendments concern the decision-making procedure
The Commission in its proposal wanted to have sole authority to change the rules
In my report we have asked that the procedure known as the Article procedure be reinstated so that the Council takes decisions on the basis of proposals from the Commission and after consulting the European Parliament
I personally believe that this procedure although cumbersome will allow us to preserve specific rules for wine promoting its status as an agricultural product
In view of wine imports from third countries and the intentions that some people have as we well know European wine must retain its status as a local quality product
In this connection the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development adopted an amendment which I had put forward prohibiting the vinification of musts imported from third countries
If this proposal is accepted by the Council in the form in which we adopted it the quality image of European wines will be preserved
With regard to structure the Committee on Agriculture adopted the principle of the right to growth by an increase of % in the vineyard while preserving restrictions on planting
Vineyards with an expanding market will be able to obtain other rights on condition that the Member States and where appropriate their regions genuinely monitor them
This was what led us to adopt a specific amendment on maintaining the rules on the computerised vineyard register
The duration of planting rights has been extended to allow the land to be rested as necessary
Other structural measures were adopted concerning the renewal and regeneration of the vineyard
We have also included measures relating to the vinification tool
If we finance measures allowing the quality of the grape to be improved the vinification tool must also be adapted so that the wine will be of good quality
Finally the Committee on Agriculture concerned about the future of the wine-growing profession wanted all structural measures taken to give priority to young wine growers either on their establishment or during the period when their holdings are growing
In the area of market management we wanted to set up distillation for the purpose of supplying potable alcohol so that European viticulture can preserve its own market
Moreover as far as crisis distillation is concerned we have adopted an amendment specifying that it should be compulsory rather than optional on condition that it targets only those regions and products in which there is a surplus
Budgetary reasons and considerations of fairness argue in favour of our position
With regard to producer organisations the committee has changed the Commission proposal only slightly
Nevertheless it has deleted measures extending their powers and has reserved the tasks given to them for its members alone
As for the interbranch organisations which we have called trade organisations we have completely changed the Commission proposal which seemed to us to be more suited to the fruit and vegetable sector
Sometimes of course if there is no prospect of a result compromises are hastily stitched together simply to paper over the problems for the time being
That is not the case here That is why I am very grateful to Mr Martin
Where wine growing in the European Union is concerned we must make sure above all that the wine and the regions in which the wine is produced are not seen solely from the point of view of the end product
It really makes a difference whether I see the wine be it directly from the wood or in the bottle just as a product or whether I see the whole culture and the whole region behind it and how it is part of the landscape
I therefore believe that it is worthwhile for Europe to take special care of its wine
It is at this point and I may be speaking on behalf of my group but I do come from a northern Member State that I should like to thank Mr Martin because he has shown a feel for the peculiarities of wine growing for how wine-growing traditions and also oenological practices have developed over centuries almost and because his proposals have made it possible for us actually to forget the dispute we had for a very long time between northern southern and central Europe
Problems will remain and new ones will arise
When I think of the amount of rectified concentrated grape must which is coming into the European Union in increasing quantities from outside it seems that we will also have to call on the Commission to be watchful here
I think it is particularly positive that flexibility is being preserved where new planting rights are concerned and that a fair compromise has been found here
It was decided to increase the area under vines by % by 
Although many would have liked to have seen more for others this already goes too far
On distillation the approach which is the same as that adopted by the Commission is absolutely right namely that we need to cut back on compulsory distillation and that here too we need to introduce a little more market but that we should keep compulsory distillation as an instrument to be used in the future where it proves to be necessary
A particularly positive initiative both in the Commission proposals and in the proposals which we discussed and adopted in committee is the specific and rather privileged because it is necessary support for young producers
Anything which is important in terms of actively supporting young farmers is particularly important where young wine producers are concerned
I should like to say even at this early stage that of course my group wishes to support the rapporteur in his efforts to maintain the compromise reached in the committee and to examine with due care all the amendments which could unravel that compromise
There are a number of amendments which are in the spirit of the compromise but there are also a whole series of amendments which could destroy it
Our group would like to support it to make it possible for the considerable amount of work which we did in the committee with Mr Martin to be crowned with a large majority at the vote in Parliament
The Commission supports this and the Council would be well advised to take this good compromise produced by Parliament as the basis for its deliberations because it has in fact failed to make a start on these negotiations for at least the last three years
Mr President I too should like to begin by thanking the rapporteur and his colleagues because they have produced a very good piece of work
This new Commission proposal has taken us down a different path from the one we took in and 
At that time Parliament was split The proposal Commissioner Fischler was also not nearly as good as this one
Circumstances have changed in some respects while in others they have remained the same
Compared with the s surpluses have tended to decrease
Unfortunately per capita consumption has fallen in the main producer countries Italy and France
As a result of the GATT round we have new competitors in the quality wine sector a fact which we have borne in mind and this is where we have made real progress under the leadership of the rapporteur Mr Martin in this Parliament we have finally accepted the special regional characteristics of wine growing in the north and south of Europe
That is where the real progress has been made
That is why my group the PPE has not as a group tabled any amendments to the Agriculture Committee proposal and against Mr Martin compromises
I should like once again to outline briefly why we have acted in this way
I believe that in this new proposal we have successfully put right what was wrong with the old organisation of the market in wine
Take the subject of distillation for a start
Compulsory distillation has not proved its worth
It is right to make it voluntary
On the other hand it is also right and that is why we have also voted in favour of various compromises for the potable alcohol market to have a guaranteed supply of wine for example for cognac brandy and other products which are traditional regional specialities
Secondly for the very first time we have a legal base for producer associations and trade organisations
We want to make this rather less complicated than it is in the Commission proposal
That is why we support the Agriculture Committee call for a framework regulation There is we have agreed in our group just one point on which we wish to depart from the compromise
This relates to the first indent of Amendment No 
Mr Martin we have agreed that we want to settle the issue of compulsory packaging in the area of production as previously discussed in the Lulling report and not now and that we want above all to wait for the decision of the European Court of Justice on this issue
We will be voting against the first indent at that point
On all the other issues however we have supported reasonable compromises on the status quo for saccharose on oenological procedures and on diverse traditions
I believe that overall we can vote in favour of this draft report
For the first time Parliament has the opportunity to speak with one voice on this very controversial issue and thus and most importantly to influence the Commission and the Agriculture Council
Applause
Mr President I do believe that this time we have come up with a helpful document on the common organisation of the market in such a complicated sector as that of wine growing and wine making
I also feel that the Commission proposal though initially valid has nevertheless been substantially improved by Parliament report
Wine growing and wine making naturally take place in certain specific areas with a long tradition of growing vines areas where replacing vines with other crops would prove difficult
The producers have years of experience in making wine and it is traditional to drink wine Wine used to be almost the only alcoholic drink consumed by the local people
However as a result of the so-called globalisation of society the situation has changed dramatically in recent years
This COM seeks to bring production into line with market demand and in that respect I believe it is a positive move
I feel it is helpful to allow a slight increase in new planting and also welcome the measures designed to allow new young growers to become involved in this traditional process
I have no wish to discuss the various methods of wine making some of which have long been established in certain Member States
Each area has its own way of making wine
Consumers however are a key element of our society and certainly deserve consideration
It is not enough simply to put the wine on the market
A certain amount of information is called for together with research into the beneficial effects of wine and education in the sensible consumption of this product
Wine does have a beneficial effect on health and should be considered as a food
Wine and health is a nice phrase but we cannot just depend on tradition
It is up to the producers associations to make information available to the consumers
Mr President it is unusual for Parliament to deal with the same issue twice in a single legislature
Fortunately the context of the common organisation of the market in wine is now radically different from what it was at the beginning of this legislature
The difference lies in the nature of the Commission proposal
The proposal put before us early in the present legislature was based on what I would call an apocalyptic vision of anticipated surpluses
In the Commission view the only way of pre-empting such a situation was the mass destruction of vines
Fortunately the ensuing proposal gave rise to such opposition within the Council that the matter was shelved
Five years later the situation is radically different due to the fact that the proposal put forward by the Commission is so unlike the previous one
Reality is stubborn
Five years have gone by and the much-feared structural surpluses have not materialised The Commission draconian proposals therefore no longer make sense
It is worth pointing out that proposals of this nature abound in the Commission when reforms affecting mainly the southern Member States are at issue
Of crucial importance to us today however are the rigour and quality expected from research undertaken by the Commission in its role as the institution charged with putting forward legislative proposals
This is of key importance when what is at stake is the whole package of agricultural reforms contained in Agenda 
Often problems can arise not only from research undertaken but also from what is omitted or has not been done
I trust the Commission present proposals will not have the negative consequences of the reform as far as the grubbing up of vines and the loss of agricultural jobs are concerned
As regards Mr Martin report I must congratulate him on the excellent work he has carried out
His report is coherent and this is particularly commendable as he has had to deal appropriately with a great many amendments
I would however like to highlight and I know he will not take it amiss a fundamental problem which remains unresolved
It appears that the use of sucrose for enrichment will continue to be permitted
A valuable opportunity to replace sucrose with concentrated musts might therefore be lost
Replacing sucrose with must would be in line with traditional practice and would allow wine making to be based entirely on the vineyard
In conclusion Mr Martin I should like to remind you of a visit you made to my country and to thank you for having taken the trouble to go there and to meet with the agricultural organisations
I am most grateful to you for doing so and feel that some good has come from it
Mr President I hope it was not under the influence of wine that such wide-ranging agreement has been reached in this Parliament
But if Dionysus has helped us to reach agreement so much the better
The truth is that Philippe-Armand Martin report while defending the status quo also manages to modernise and adapt it to the new circumstances of the globalised market to make it flexible and to free it from the Commission inherent dirigiste tendency It places the onus on Member States producer organisations and committees of viticultural experts and increases the responsibility of both producers and Member States governments
It also takes into account the need to increase our wine production market conditions permitting but at the same time to ensure that this is achieved through greater cooperation between the Member States
I have no doubt that very simple measures are called for such as reliable registers something that does not exist right now
We must also prevent the fraudulent use of concentrated must for example and in our negotiations with certain third countries we should apply a very low tolerance threshold about the fraud practised in those countries
As for compulsory distillation we should be more flexible
And this implies greater responsibility on the part of whoever decides whether or not to distil on the basis of market fluctuations
But arbitrary senseless compulsory distillation should not be the rule
Another important point is to respect oenological identities regional oenological practices and to avoid pointless squabbles I have to say that I am sick and tired of arguments that frankly have not improved relations among European wine growers
I also think it is important and I must confess that this is an extremely sensitive area for Portugal to look at the issues of bottling in the region of origin of accountability and of quality wines which are products with a considerable international reputation
We therefore disagree with Amendments Nos and and we or at least the Members closest to me will be voting against them
Otherwise I think this is an extremely positive report because we have avoided consensus for consensus sake but have reached a proper agreement
That is what is of interest consensus for its own sake is little short of treachery but an agreement is a contract in everyone interest
Mr President the reform of the organisation of the market in wine is another case where the EU must eliminate the problems at their source instead of only intervening as it always does when the floodgates have already been breached
Distillation and the grubbing-up premium are typical end-of-pipe solutions
They actually ought to be abolished because distillation is an invitation to produce massive quantities of lower-quality wine and the grubbing-up premium encourages the transfer of production from regions which are problematic in terms of labour costs but important in terms of regional culture to rationalised export-driven production
We will only counter overproduction by introducing comprehensive new quality criteria
I would caution against the belief that here too genetic engineering can be of assistance
We wish to retain the historical lands developed and cultivated by man and to safeguard an appropriate income for wine growers
In the long term quality is the only way this can be achieved
I am particularly concerned about this because I believe that we will only be able to defend our European viniculture at the next WTO round if we are able to throw something into the ring related to the environment social policy and quality because the Americans would like to have our designation of origin off the negotiating table and to negotiate about brand names instead
That would mean that Coca-Cola could buy the Bordeaux name and then resell the cheapest wines in the world under that name
But that is not what we want
We must therefore have good arguments to explain why designation of origin needs to consist of more than alcohol content quality grade and colour
The much vaunted EU model of agriculture will only carry weight and have any substance if we are able to designate regional social and environmental characteristics for each wine and thus also enter into the negotiations on the offensive
We support Mr Martin report and we say one thing quality not quantity
Mr President Commissioner ladies and gentlemen firstly I would like very much to thank our rapporteur Philippe Martin for his excellent report which takes account of all Europe vineyards
I was there when at the beginning of August Mr Martin met viticulture and trade representatives of the Languedoc-Roussillon region in the town hall at Carcassonne
I was pleased to note that their principal demands were included both in the report and in the vote in the Committee on Agriculture
What are these principal demands
With regard to wine-growing potential we must preserve the principle of limiting rights by providing for the right to growth of % in the short term with the possibility of updating this in line with market needs once a proper inventory of planting rights has been carried out
With regard to improving vineyards I must stress the importance of this structural component
As an elected representative of the biggest wine-growing region in Europe whose vineyards have undergone considerable renewal I can assure you Commissioner that quality is essential for the future of viticulture
This is why we have asked that the whole of the reconversion component should allow regeneration of the vineyard and vinification tools
All of these structural measures both in terms of wine-growing potential and vineyard improvement must give priority to young wine growers
As far as market management is concerned we must maintain compulsory distillation of by-products apart from existing derogations
The alcohols produced must be suitable for the potable alcohol market in order to reduce the budgetary cost of this measure
As for crisis distillation in order to be efficient this must remain compulsory only in the regions in which there is a surplus
With regard to authorisation in the sector the tasks and responsibilities of the producer groups have to be recognised even though the rules cannot be extended
I therefore consider the report as adopted in the Committee on Agriculture to be perfectly suitable
With regard to oenological practices we must draw up an exhaustive list of authorised practices and preserve the principle of status quo including in aid for enrichment using concentrated musts
I would like in particular to draw your attention to Amendment No on the production of natural sweet wines
Here too we need to maintain a list of compulsory information to be given on the labels
Finally Mr President with regard to trade with third countries we must keep in place the current rules prohibiting vinification of musts from third countries
If this ban is lifted as the Commission proposes there is a danger that the image of wines produced in the European Union will be considerably damaged and that there will be an actual reduction in quality which is inconsistent with the objectives of the COM
In conclusion I must just mention the procedure proposed by the Commission both for managing planting rights and for labelling oenological practices and market management measures
Contrary to the Commission proposals we must preserve the current procedure known as the Article procedure
Mr President I very much hope that all Members will vote in favour of the main body of the proposals by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development which are the result of considerable effort by Mr Martin to compromise in order to be fair realistic and open and I congratulate him
It is essentially a question of ensuring that wine remains a more strictly defined agricultural product banning imports of musts from third countries allowing vineyards to increase in size in line with market demand maintaining the status quo on oenological practices including dry sugaring and having compulsory crisis distillation only in regions where there is a surplus
As the text does not specifically mention natural sweet wines I along with several other Members tabled Amendment No in order to refer to them expressly which is essential if we are to adhere to our common aim of respecting the diversity of the terroirs which give European wines their quality and individuality
In conclusion Mr Martin I shall be tabling two or three amendments for example on GMO in the hope that this new wording will be acceptable to the rapporteur and to all the Members
Mr President we have been dealing with this wine dossier for six years now which shows how important or even doubly important it is
It is important firstly because our wine growers are important
They account for % of agricultural GDP and only % of budgetary expenditure which means that wine growers bring in a lot of revenue and cost very little
It is important also for the economy in general because viticulture is a key item in our balance of trade
Moreover on the issue of the balance of trade Commissioner I fear that your proposal is rather putting us at risk
We know what the Commission proposal involves
It is based as always in the field of agriculture on the fallacy of overproduction
According to you by the year we would have produced million hectolitres of wine
We would consume million of these leaving a surplus of million hectolitres of wine
Hence the measures you proposed in early harvests wine quotas in short all the extreme measures that we know so well
Fortunately today we know that in the figures balanced and you agreed to compromise
Technically therefore there were positive changes
But I believe that beneath the surface the Commission negative attitudes remain
I will look firstly at the positive changes
It is true that from the Sierra Bardaji report in to the Fantuzzi report in and now the Martin report we have succeeded by means of amendments in this case in improving the situation amendments on distillation which is now compulsory amendments on new planting rights of % on regeneration of vineyards on rest periods for the land on potable alcohols on aid for concentrated must and not merely for the CIII zones which worried my wine growers in Languedoc-Roussillon and those of Raymond Chesa amendments also on inspectors as we had only two inspectors for the whole of Europe and perhaps even on interbranch organisations which go back to Maréchal Pétain and are supported by the Left
But that is not the important point
We may even have made progress in the religious war on dry sugaring
However I fear that other more sinister attitudes are lurking beneath these technical concessions
There are four as far as I can see Malthusianism fundamentalism internationalism and dehumanisation
With regard to Malthusianism firstly as is the case with meat cereal milk and even coal and steel you only ever have one management instrument a drastic cut in supply
You never look into developing demand
It is true that we must prepare for the opening of the wine market to the East with the arrival of Hungarian Romanian and Bulgarian wines and even the World Trade Organisation in the year with our Australian Californian and South African friends
Fundamentalism in this case is the fiscal anti-wine fundamentalism of Northern Europe with euros in excise duty on each litre of wine in Denmark and the United Kingdom
It is the health fundamentalism that is seen in Sweden and Finland where they are lax about drugs but puritans when it comes to alcohol even though wine is a health product with positive cardiovascular effects to say nothing of the mental effects of beer-drinking seen in the hooligans at Heisel
Internationalism is the six million hectolitres of imports a tenth of a euro in customs duties and the famous concentrated musts from third countries that you were preparing to authorise
Fortunately the Commission was able to resist
All that was needed to perfect this internationalism was to authorise wines in bulk and not to authorise bottling in the region of production
This brings me to the fourth and final undesirable effect that of dehumanisation which would make wine an industrial product rather than an agricultural one
This is the source of the conflict between the beer-drinkers of Northern Europe and the wine-drinkers elsewhere in Europe and I fear this must affect the balance in the Council of Ministers
But I would suggest to the House that if there had ever been vines in Saudi Arabia this would have changed the strategic face of the world
I fear there must be some complicity here between the fundamentalism of the North and the fundamentalism of the South since neither of them drink wine
Question Time Commission
The next item is questions to the Commission B
Question No by Paul Rübig H
Subject The euro in textbooks The smooth introduction of the single currency and its acceptance by European citizens will depend to a very great extent on how rapidly and comprehensively information can be provided in the educational sector
Particular attention will of course be paid to educational establishments and subjects which are in general concerned with currency aspects for example commercial colleges and subjects such as accountancy and bookkeeping
Can the representative of the Commission present today say what progress has been achieved in the transition to the euro in the educational sector and in particular in updating textbooks and teaching materials
I should like to welcome Mrs Cresson and ask her to reply to Mr Rübig question
You have the floor Mrs Cresson
The Commission is aware of the major challenge which the transition to the euro represents for the educational sector
Children will play a crucial role in helping parents to adapt to the single currency
While respecting the exclusive competence of the Member States in this area the Commission is supporting several projects within the Socrates programme which are helping to disseminate information on the euro in schools and to integrate this topic into the different curriculum subjects
A number of concrete measures are worth mentioning here
A working group entitled Education and the euro has been set up comprising representatives of the Ministers for Education and the national agencies of the Socrates programme
This group work concerns the promotion of educational initiatives on the euro and the exchange of information and good practice in this area
The work of this group has led notably to the creation of an inventory of educational tools and initiatives on the euro both at national and Community level which is accessible on the Internet on the page entitled The euro at school on the Europa server
A handbook describing Member States initiatives in this area particularly concerning the training of teachers and adaptation of school syllabuses and textbooks is currently being put together
This document will also be available on the Internet and will be distributed to interested parties
Commissioner I should like to ask a supplementary question if this is being offered on the Internet and multimedia information is thus also being made available do you see any chance of this being learning entertainment or a learning adventure which will make it an enjoyable experience for people to learn about this subject because in the end it is also a question of parents finding out from their children what prospects this has to offer for the future
As far as the research programme is concerned I would be interested to know whether there are programmes in the research sector which address the issue of how the euro can best be introduced and what problems might arise when this actually happens so that these can once again be overcome by giving instruction before the event
This activity or action does not directly concern the research sector but rather the education sector As I said we are indeed intending to disseminate information via the Internet which will be designed for schools and will therefore be presented in the most attractive format possible
The idea of designing innovative educational software and games has not been ruled out
Moreover I would point out that every year we carry out a project of Internet and multimedia dissemination during a week of what are known as net days
What is really at stake here is not protecting copyright that is already guaranteed by Article of the directive but maintaining the current state of freedom of access to the Internet for everyone and not just the big boys
The requirement for technical copies to be authorised adopted by the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens Rights would actually have the effect of extending to the digital sphere the dominance which the multinationals already enjoy over the way in which music is conventionally distributed
We therefore take the view that it is necessary to redraft Article to avoid limiting de facto access to the networks for independent operators
Furthermore we believe it necessary to encourage the investments of independent access providers who are the natural partners of independent music producers in Europe
The reality is that European producers primarily need unrestricted and low-cost access to the networks in order to be able to offer the kind of music which the big multinationals regard as uneconomical in terms of their own commercial criteria
In offering their product on the Internet the companies also need to use systems compatible with the interfaces most commonly used by consumers as they cannot run the risk of investing in websites that might subsequently prove incompatible with the new versions of dominant software
Secondly European producers need programmes of support similar to those through which the audiovisual sector is supported via the media
Finally they need strategic research and development programmes that will allow the European music industry and the European technology industry to establish by common accord standards for the secure and effective distribution of music as an alternative to the American analogue standards
For all of these reasons the non-attached Members believe that it is right to reassess the situation and are therefore calling for the directive to be referred back to committee
Mr President creative and innovative activities will be critical to the development of the information society
This proposal for a directive is an important part of the legislative framework which is currently being drawn up at both a European and a global level to guarantee harmonious development of the information society
The information society is in fact evolving in a global context
In the international community adopted two treaties under the auspices of WIPO one on copyright and the other on interpretation and performance and on phonograms
I would remind the House that the European Union played a vital role in the drafting of those treaties
It can now accede to them as the European Community and be among the first to ratify them
The United States has already met its requirements
Thirty instruments of ratification will have to be deposited before the treaties enter into force
The European Union accounts for because of the agreements that link it to the countries of the European Economic Area and the countries of Central and Eastern Europe and the fact that it has association agreements with still more countries
Ratification of the treaties by the Union and its Member States is based on their incorporation into the national legal systems it is their incorporation into Community law that is among other things the objective of this proposal
Alongside meeting our international commitments the basic aim of the proposal is to put in place a harmonised legislative framework for copyright and related rights
We expect that greater legal certainty guaranteeing investment in creative and innovative activity and in the network infrastructures will boost growth and the competitiveness of the European industry and job creation
It is for us to tap this huge cultural and economic potential by providing the appropriate legislative framework
In drafting and adopting this proposal which as you will remember is the product of wide-ranging consultation dating back to the Commission has taken the greatest care to retain a fair balance between the various rights and interests at issue which are frequently in open conflict
I am well aware that this was also the aim of Parliament work
On behalf of the Commission I wish to thank the rapporteur Mr Barzanti for having done his job so efficiently
He has managed to combine a thorough understanding of the problem founded also on the earlier work on the Green Paper and the communication with the great resolve that tackling such sensitive proposals demands
Fifty-eight amendments have been tabled of which relate to the operative part of the text and to the recitals of those amendments the Commission is able to accept and to take into consideration but it has to reject 
The amendments the Commission is able to accept are the following Amendments Nos and 
The Commission will take into account the following amendments albeit with a number of mainly drafting changes Amendments Nos and the new Amendments Nos and 
As far as the recitals are concerned the Commission rejects Amendment No which in our view confuses protected work and information in general and is contrary to the principles of the acquis communautaire the first part of Amendment No which is incompatible with the WIPO treaty though we accept the second part
Amendment No which does not in our view succeed in defining the concept of public a responsibility we believe is best left to the Member States which are in a better position to define this somewhat elastic term
Amendment No which does not correspond to the amendments tabled in relation to Article b
Amendment No because it calls into question the approach taken in the proposal to the exceptions
Amendments Nos and which are already covered by the third recital and Amendments Nos and because they are too far outside the scope of the proposal
Turning then to the actual articles of the directive the Commission rejects Amendment No because the issue it tackles is taken into account in Article 
Amendments Nos and which are designed to introduce new exceptions for the benefit of broadcasters I wish to deal separately in just a moment with our rejection of Amendment No concerning Article Amendment No because the concern on which it is based is amply taken into account by Article c an amendment at your suggestion and Amendment No because that issue is being dealt with under the th recital amended by Amendment No 
As regards the amendments tabled at this part-session given that they either reflect viewpoints and concerns already taken into account in the report of the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens Rights or are amendments rejected by that committee the Commission endorses the report
Of the new amendments we are able to take into account only Nos and which relate to mediation a point mentioned by Mr Perry and taken up by Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi
Overall the Commission is thus able to take Parliament line on many points
I repeat we are rejecting amendments taking account of and accepting 
To conclude I have two points to make concerning two specific issues
As far as the broadcasters are concerned the House is proposing to add three new exceptions for their benefit
I would remind you of our interest in observing a balance between the rights and interests which are at stake
The Commission accepts Amendment No which introduces an exception for broadcasters in respect of specific acts of reproduction necessary to facilitate a legitimate broadcasting act because it meets a genuine technological need
In contrast and in an effort to achieve a balance between the interests in play the Commission feels compelled to reject Amendments Nos and the first of which introduces an exception that would allow broadcasters to make available on request programmes largely consisting of phonograms
We then come to Article the source of such controversy
What is the purpose of that provision
It is designed to establish an exception to the right of reproduction in regard to some technical acts of reproduction that are an integral part of a technological process carried out for the sole purpose of enabling a different use to be made of the protected material
This is the only mandatory exception in the whole of the proposal and it is therefore very clearly drafted
That provision will give the telecommunications operators and service providers the legal certainty they need to be able to perform operations for the benefit of the network services which are very often transnational in nature
We have subdivided your proposals on this and are able to take account of some
As far as the definition of the scope of the exceptions is concerned we are able to accept the inclusion of the words transient and incidental as providing a closer definition of the concept of temporary that appears in our proposal and of the word essential which further defines the incidental nature of the act in relation to the technical transmission process
Consequently we reject Amendments Nos and which have the effect of watering down the latter condition
We cannot however accept the concept of economic significance for the rightholder
The reference to our concept of independent economic significance is consistent with the aim of the exception and therefore workable when the exception is actually applied
It is in any event worth bearing in mind that protection against unjustified economic harm is provided for in Article 
Finally we cannot accept the insertion of the clause referring to uses authorised or permitted by law the addition of which would mean that the exception would be triggered only in relation to items whose use had been authorised by the rightholders or permitted by law
We are aware of the concerns of rightholders who fear that the network will end up acting as a broadcasting vehicle for items that have been illegally copied pirated items but if we are to hit our target we have to consider beforehand what is the most workable and balanced way of achieving it
In this case that way has to be sought by ensuring a proper balance between rights and exceptions to those rights
Finally I would draw your attention to a very important group of amendments those concerning private copies
Your amendments uphold two important principles the right of rightholders to fair remuneration and the fine distinction concerning private digital copies
The first principle protects a need for equity it is a measured step forwards in the quest for legal certainty in this sector
The Commission acceptance of the amendment relating to digital copies for private use must be seen in the context of the approach already set out in recitals and of our proposal
Specifically in the light of what is set out in those sections of the proposal the Commission agrees to recognise the principle that in the digital sphere the possibility of making a copy for private use must exist without prejudice to the effective and workable technical means that are capable of protecting the interests of rightholders
We therefore align ourselves with the solution you have put forward though the amendment will have to be redrafted in such a way as to provide an accurate statement of the principle
You link not only analogue and digital copies for private use but also the exceptions concerning illustration and teaching to the principle of fair remuneration for rightholders
That is a formula which allows broader harmonisation and respects the traditions and practices of the Member States
The Commission is able to follow Parliament line here too and therefore accepts Amendments Nos and as well as Amendments No and 
The protection of technological measures forms the subject-matter of Article of the proposal which has been substantially recast by your Amendments Nos and 
We are able to take those amendments into consideration subject to a degree of clarification which the Commission considers important
We congratulate Mr Barzanti on a comprehensive and determined piece of work
I welcome the fact that you support the Commission proposal in terms of both the overall approach and I think I can honestly say this the main components
In the past Parliament influence has been decisive in the adoption of the five directives already in force the cooperation that exists between Parliament and the Commission in the field of copyright and related rights is something we can rely on and for that I am truly grateful
Mr President I put a specific question about the compatibility of this amended copyright directive with the proposal for a directive on electronic commerce that the Commission made to the Parliament and the Council
In the proposal on electronic commerce the country of origin is the principal component In this copyright directive it could be the country of destination
That is why I asked my question and the Commisioner did not answer it
Mr President I am fully aware that I did not answer This was because of time constraints
However I shall now answer very briefly
The Commission submitted its proposal on the legal framework for electronic commerce last year
Both proposals are independent and each has its own crucial importance
According to the proposal on electronic commerce the country of origin principle does not apply to intellectual and industrial property in accordance with existing international law
The debate is closed
The vote will be taken tomorrow at noon
Common organisation of the market in wine
The next item is the report A by Mr P Martin on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development on the proposal for a Council Regulation EC on the common organisation of the market in wine CCNS
Mr President Commissioner ladies and gentlemen the common organisation of the market in wine is certainly the most complex of all the COMs because it includes not only aspects relating to vineyard management and conditions of grape production but also all rules concerning oenological practices the processing of wine as well as rules on labelling
The very structure of the text of the COM in wine shows us that wine is an agricultural product rather than an industrial product
In the time I have been allocated I am not going to present all of the amendments that are included in my report and that are the result of a vote in committee on almost amendments tabled by all Members
I would like at this stage of my presentation to thank firstly all the officials in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development and all those colleagues who made my task easier for me and enabled me to draw up a coherent report
What are the central themes of my report
Firstly a significant number of amendments concern the decision-making procedure
The Commission in its proposal wanted to have sole authority to change the rules
In my report we have asked that the procedure known as the Article procedure be reinstated so that the Council takes decisions on the basis of proposals from the Commission and after consulting the European Parliament
I personally believe that this procedure although cumbersome will allow us to preserve specific rules for wine promoting its status as an agricultural product
In view of wine imports from third countries and the intentions that some people have as we well know European wine must retain its status as a local quality product
In this connection the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development adopted an amendment which I had put forward prohibiting the vinification of musts imported from third countries
If this proposal is accepted by the Council in the form in which we adopted it the quality image of European wines will be preserved
With regard to structure the Committee on Agriculture adopted the principle of the right to growth by an increase of % in the vineyard while preserving restrictions on planting
Vineyards with an expanding market will be able to obtain other rights on condition that the Member States and where appropriate their regions genuinely monitor them
This was what led us to adopt a specific amendment on maintaining the rules on the computerised vineyard register
The duration of planting rights has been extended to allow the land to be rested as necessary
We think that it is worth pointing out the effort and the persistence that the Commissioner has demonstrated on this dossier
I would also emphasise the contributions of the three rapporteurs
With regard to the COPE Fund it is as has already been said here a supplement
It is intended to meet the needs and the cover the risks of the most serious situations such as those that have been mentioned here at some length
Beyond this many other risks remain
Of course maritime transport which is subject to the rules of competition must also have its rules strengthened under the IMO in order to enable its economic activities to continue to be profitable without sacrificing safety not only in Europe and the United States but in all seas and oceans
The timeliness and the objectives of the agency have also already been discussed here at some length
I think that the rapporteur reasonably points out some loopholes but I also feel that it is not Parliament place to manage the agency but instead to supervise the administrative rules and good practices of this and other similar agencies
What the agency must guarantee is absolute fairness and equal cooperation between the Member States and must also ensure the participation of the public of those in the profession and of the other economic and social interests concerned
The agency independence must therefore be a paradigm an essential factor for it to be respected for it to allay the concerns of the public and to develop and encourage plans for action and cooperation at European level
This is certainly what is needed and as many speakers have stated here there are many potential locations for the agency since there are several candidates which are all equally competent and well prepared
I think that Lisbon is probably the most appropriate
Mr President if Cyprus and Malta accede to the Union or rather when not if the Union will have the largest merchant fleet in the world
Not so much because these two countries are huge maritime powers but because many shipowners find them convenient and I use the English term advisedly
A large fleet is an advantage of that there can be no doubt But it entails a great deal of responsibility
We must therefore ensure that our fleet is safe safety on our own doorstep is paramount but elsewhere too the European flag must stand for quality
When I reported to Parliament on enlargement and transport I held a great many talks with people in positions of responsibility in the candidate countries
They were all very quick to promise that they would transpose the relevant acquis into their national law
However as I pointed out even then things were still in the pipeline especially the Erika II package under discussion today
That alone was cause for concern
Talks on transposing European law or to use the Community jargon implementing the acquis soon got bogged down
In one case I was even told that the inspector responsible was on holiday
We shall need much more than one inspector if we want to use serious prompt all-encompassing controls in order to prevent further disasters on our or anyone else doorstep
We shall need sufficient numbers of trained inspectors and we shall need them quickly
The present Member States can do a great deal to help here
Twinning and the temporary secondment of well-trained specialists working in existing management and control structures recently proved to be a very effective instrument in reintegrating former East Germany
We could apply this model here too
With measures to guarantee that foreseeable problems will be dealt with promptly by well-organised accession mechanisms we could contribute to the success of the enlargement process and more importantly win our citizens over
There are already more than enough concerns and fears on the question of enlargement
We must address these concerns and fears be they major concerns or concerns about individual specialist aspects such as those under discussion today
I almost said there are a lot of Irish among us
Parliamentarians on the Administrative Board not the best way of involving Parliament I think
The Commission should monitor the agency and we should monitor the Commission
As an Austrian I unfortunately have no high-sea ports to offer
We lost our last sea battle a hundred years ago
But I should like to think that we too could offer a pleasing location should one be wanted
Mr President ladies and gentlemen it is high time we woke up and noticed the kind of environmental and safety risks associated with maritime transport and particularly with tankers
Oil catastrophes have concretely shown that relying on good luck costs society dear
Unfortunately difficult decisions often make progress only when a catastrophe and the reactions of voters force politicians to act
The Erika II package under discussion therefore deserves all possible support
I would like to congratulate all three rapporteurs for drawing up thorough reports
The Erika II package certains very many positive proposals among which I would particularly like to mention the setting up of emergency ports and the automatic monitoring of vessels
The setting up of a maritime safety agency will also improve coordination on safety issues
Although we Europeans can affect the condition of our maritime environment very significantly we must always remember that we are not alone in the world even after enlargement
A large number of vessels originating from other than EU Member States travel near the shores of Europe
Therefore we must take care that the well-intentioned measures of Europe do not impede the creation of international agreements
One example is the European oil pollution compensation fund COPE
Setting up the fund must not mean reducing willingness to achieve a wider solution under the auspices of the IMO
Oil pollutes just as much and clean-up costs are identical whether the vessel is registered in the EU or for example under the Liberian flag
Ladies and gentlemen safeguarding the cleanliness of our seas and especially our coastline means we must not hesitate a minute longer
t is time to act decisively so that the worst problems can be removed once and for all
In this way we will ensure that no Jessica Angelica or even Marika Package is required in the future
Mr President ladies and gentlemen I would first of all like to thank and congratulate the three rapporteurs Mr Sterckx Mr Mastorakis and Mr Esclopé on their magnificent reports on the safety of maritime traffic the creation of a European Maritime Safety Agency and compensation for oil pollution
Furthermore I would like to thank them for having presented and prepared these reports within such a short timescale and for the attention they have paid to the problem of maritime safety
However like many of today speakers I regret the fact that we are discussing the Erika II package without having yet adopted Erika I although I hope that within the conciliation procedure we will achieve a positive result as soon as possible
Nevertheless I would also like to say that the Erika I and Erika II packages are already having practical effects within the International Maritime Organisation where we have managed to make progress on making double-hulled or similar ships compulsory for the transportation of oil and also with regard to the current discussion on increasing the figures in order to cover liabilities which will very possibly exceed USD million they are currently million and also in relation to countries such as Cyprus and Malta which and I address this to Mr Rack are making an enormous effort to improve the characteristics of their fleets within the framework of their incorporation into the European Union accepting the requirements of the Erika I and Erika II packages before they enter into force
Before the end of the year I will present a proposal on safety on ferries although we know what happened in the case of the Samina Express they were watching football
Greek justice is taking action
I believe we must mark out territories
It is the Member States who have all the responsibilities in the criminal field
I will refer to the proposed directive on maritime traffic which is the most advanced one in terms of its preparation and I believe this is indicated by the consensus in relation to it
We broadly support all the amendments with slight modifications of the wording of those which are aimed at improving or specifying the scope of the text
Also in part with some modifications Amendments Nos and which are extremely important on the refuge area
With some modifications the amendments which are aimed at improving the assessment of the implementation of the Directive on the ground specifically Amendments Nos and 
We cannot accept the current wording of Amendment No on black boxes although I understand the rapporteur objectives the formulation used makes this requirement dependent on a prior decision by the IMO
We are not prepared to accept this
If the IMO is able to make progress we will have to move ahead but we know that good work is being done within the International Maritime Organisation and what we want is to put more pressure on as we have done in the case of double hulls
With regard to the proposal for the European Maritime Safety Agency I would thank you for Parliament positive approach to our proposal and the support it is giving us
This is not a purely administrative measure but rather the Agency will increase the public visibility of the European Union commitment to increasing maritime safety to the highest possible level and preventing pollution from ships
I would like to say to those people who are concerned that the Agency may become another Community bureaucratic body that the Agency will enable the Member States to be part of and participate in an area which as we all know involves national and Community responsibilities and competences and through which we have to seek integration in order to better coordinate these actions
The Agency will enable the Commission and the Member States to work together in an independent body and that is one of its advantages
Parliament amendments do not alter the spirit of the Commission proposal and focus principally on the administrative structure
The Commission supports Amendments Nos and and we can also accept Amendment No which makes it possible for the Agency to offer technical assistance to the candidate countries without a specific request from the Commission
We can also accept Amendments Nos and which clarify the mandate of the principal directors of this body
In relation to Amendments Nos and on the Administrative Board I must say that we accept Amendments Nos and insofar as they eliminate the presence of Parliament and if these amendments are incorporated we will have to make the necessary adjustments
In relation to the location of the Agency Amendment No seems more logical than No 
Objective criteria are specified for the selection and I fully agree with this and believe that it can be incorporated
We accept that the external evaluation of the Agency be subject to the conditions set by the Administrative Board as Amendment No requests in part although we do not think it is necessary to repeat the evaluation every years as it suggests
With regard to the visits which the officials of the agencies must make to the Member States the Commission wishes the national administrations to actively participate in them and to assist them
We cannot therefore accept either Amendment No or No which contravene this objective
I understand the justification for Amendment No but for reasons of legal certainty I cannot accept it since the term independent adds nothing to a body with its own legal personality
Nor can I accept Amendments Nos and which imply that it is not necessary for the Commission to approve the Agency programme nor Amendments Nos and according to which the decision to make visits to the Member States should depend on a Commission opinion rather than on its agreement
Supervising the implementation of the Community acquis will remain the responsibility of the Commission and the Agency cannot replace us in this task
Lastly the Commission cannot agree with Amendments Nos and which affect the impartiality of the executive director
With regard to the third proposal on responsibility and compensation for the dumping of oil I would like to congratulate Mr Esclopé and Parliament on your work on such a complex issue
I would like to make it clear that the problems do not relate to the underlying objectives but only to the means of achieving these objectives and we should try to solve all the problems by means of a proposal designed to deal with one specific issue the lack of adequate compensation in the case of serious oil pollution
Furthermore I agree with what Mr Esclopé has said If we now add to this proposal the problems relating to other types of dumping to pollution from chemical dumping or from the cleaning out of bilge we will eventually paralyse the initiative
These types of proposals are specifically related to Conventions which are awaiting ratification and which must be ratified over the next few years
I am also prepared for us to also make some regional proposals in the event that existing Conventions are not ratified by a sufficient number of States that are members of the IMO
But since there is already an international proposal I believe that we should not be too hasty
The perfect is the enemy of the good
Let us concentrate on the dumping of oil on which we have data and certain factors which will allow us to move forward quickly
We can accept three groups of amendments which altogether make up more or less half of them
The first the nineteen amendments which seek to extend the scope of the Regulation to cover substances other than oil such as chemical and combustible substances are not acceptable as I have pointed out
The second group of amendments which refer to the role of shipowners in the COPE Fund Amendments Nos to and which seek to introduce compulsory contributions for shipowners are not compatible with international law since the international rules in force do not allow demands for additional compensation from shipowners unless the accident has been caused by fraudulent behaviour
This is one of the problems detected by the Commission in the international system in force which must be rectified on an international level and we are committed to working on this
Nevertheless given the current situation requiring shipowners to participate in compensation for damages would contravene the current international rules and we are therefore unable to accept such a proposal
But I must say that Amendments Nos to and also cause problems for the Commission because their aim is to strengthen the participation of the local representatives of the polluted region in the COPE Fund committee procedures
I would remind you that this committee is covered by the Decision on commitology and Community law does not allow its composition to be changed
Nor can we accept Amendment No which proposes removing the paragraph establishing the possibility of rejecting compensation to claimants involved in the accident that is to say shipowners charterers and company directors
It would not make sense to compensate those responsible for the pollution
I therefore prefer to keep this paragraph which allows the rejection of payments to the parties most involved in the pollution
We have problems with Amendment No which proposes reducing the period for collecting contributions and lastly with Amendments Nos and which create difficulties in practice because they fall outside the scope of the proposal
All the others either in their entirety or in part can be accepted
They are Nos and from to 
I will end by once again thanking the rapporteurs for the speed and quality of their work as well as the whole of the committee and Parliament as a whole for their support for the Erika I and Erika II packages in their entirety
I hope that all the remaining stages of negotiations in both forums will maintain the highest quality in terms of the texts and the proposals and will be completed as quickly as possible
I would also like to say that before the end of the year we shall be submitting proposals on safety in the transportation of persons of passengers
We would have liked to achieve everything by now but we must understand that sometimes we cannot achieve what everybody wants
We have however taken very significant steps forward which I insist have already had real consequences by improving safety on our seas
The debate is closed
The vote will be held tomorrow at am
Occurrence reporting in civil aviation
The next item is the debate on the report A by Mr Collins on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy Transport and Tourism on occurrence reporting in civil aviation
Mr President the continued increase in air traffic which is expected to double over the next decade is placing unprecedented pressure on air travel safety
It has been well documented that air transport is a very safe mode of transport and this should and must remain the case
However we must all work to ensure that air accidents are reduced to a bare minimum
The continent of Europe accounts for about % of all accidents worldwide while one third of air traffic takes place in European skies
It is clear that a large proportion of the measures needed to improve air safety should be geared towards preventing accidents rather than providing a response when accidents have happened
Incidents occurring in one Member State are not necessarily known in another Member State and similar circumstances can lead to fatal accidents
That is why I welcome this European Commission proposal
As a result of this new initiative all European Union Member States will establish formal incident-reporting systems to facilitate the collection of information on actual or potential safety deficiencies involving aeroplanes in Europe
Setting up a system that allows for safety and civil aviation authorities to share information available from the different reporting schemes will enable all parties involved learn from their mistakes thereby producing a safer system for all air users in future
Article of the Treaty of Maastricht introduced the legal basis for the introduction of Community measures to improve the level of transport safety in Europe thereby creating a Community competence in this field
The adoption of a directive on accident and investigation in November was the first EU response to the use of these new powers
However the limitation of the directive was that as the number of accidents is fortunately very low the opportunities to learn from them are very limited and lessons can therefore be drawn only after an accident has already happened
It is now proposed to complement this first initiative with a new directive that would address both mandatory and confidential reporting of incidents defects or malfunctions which may constitute a hazard for civil aviation operations called occurrences
The objective of this new directive is to contribute to the improvement of air safety by ensuring that essential safety information is reported and collected stored protected and disseminated in order to facilitate its effective analysis and monitoring
A network of national mandatory occurrence reporting systems will be based on a system developed by the Joint Research Centre in Ispra in Italy
These reporting systems would also be complemented by the creation of confidential reporting mechanisms which will be put in place across the territories of the European Union
The proposed European Aviation Safety Agency will need this kind of data if it is to carry out its work effectively
In conclusion it is incumbent on all legislators within the European Union to ensure that the utmost is being done to ensure that air travellers are entirely safe in the journeys they take
The specific proposal is part of a number of measures presently being proposed by the Committee on Transport of this Parliament to improve the quality and safety standards of air travel for all users
Mr President the establishment of formal reporting systems is clearly a requirement of Annex VI to the Chicago Convention on International Civil Aviation
The United Kingdom has a long-standing mandatory reporting scheme MORS currently established under Article of the Air Navigation Order and administered by the CAA
There are several established systems for the interchange of safety data for analysis such as JAA EUROCONTROL etc as well as legal ICAO requirements
I would suggest that any EU initiative be compatible with the proven effective systems in place
My initial concerns were as follows first although the proposal insists on confidentiality and disidentification of reported information which is a purely legal issue it does not satisfactorily tackle the issue of information abuse especially since data could be made available to third parties through many different channels including the so-called and loosely-defined research institutions etc
Aviation is always under close scrutiny by the media and such additional opportunities for reporting would inevitably be misused
It is therefore necessary that all parties using and providing data can genuinely trust the system
My second concern referred to Article and Annexes I and II
It is generally thought amongst safety experts that it is not the quantity of data that is important but the quality of the reporting and analysis
The lists of examples of reportable occurrences may need to be addressed
As it stands the proposal could become over-regulated difficult to manage and have no added safety benefit
My third point referred to Article 
I believe it is essential that reports from pilots and other staff members be made to their own company
Bypassing their own company structures would weaken the internal reporting processes that have been built up over the years
My final point refers to Article which appears to go too far by establishing a totally blame-free reporting system
This would need to be amended as there could be circumstances in which gross negligence is involved
My own experience over a number of years has shown that confidential reporting works extremely well
However in such a safety-sensitive industry it is important that all employees follow the strict rules regulations and practices that are laid down
I would like to thank Mr Collins for producing a comprehensive report
It was a great pleasure to work with him
I believe that we have now reached a sensible conclusion and would hope that the amendments adopted in committee which address those concerns can be supported in the plenary vote
Honourable Members I am in no doubt that all of us here welcome initiatives to enhance safety but they must be well thought through and beneficial to the entire aviation industry and the public at large
I should like to suspend the debate at this point
We shall resume the debate on this item at pm
Question Time Commission
The next item is Question Time B We shall now take questions to the Commission
Part one
Question No by H
Subject Cooperation with Afghanistan In its joint position on Afghanistan adopted on January the European Union condemns human rights violations in that country and in particular discrimination against women
What information and guarantees can the Commission give concerning access for Afghan women to European aid and cooperation programmes launched under the aegis of ECHO
The Commission wishes to underline its concern for the suffering of the entire civilian population of Afghanistan as a direct consequence of the ongoing conflict and the current drought
In this respect ECHO has this year already allocated EUR million for humanitarian aid to Afghanistan
ECHO is focusing particularly attention to vulnerable groups internally displaced people of which there are more than half a million the disabled women particularly widows and children
The needs of women and children are specifically addressed in mother-and-child health programmes
Projects are being implemented by Médecins Sans Frontires of Belgium Médecins Sans Frontires of the Netherlands and from France Action contre la Faim Aid Médicale Internationale and Médecins du Monde
All aim to treat malnutrition among children under five years of age as well as monitoring the health status of women in particular nursing mothers and pregnant women
Usually NGOs also provide their female patients with elementary hygiene education
These projects are implemented in areas where internally displaced people have settled
Currently there are medical projects in the Panjsher Valley Herat Kandahar Kabul Mazar-e-Sharif and Hazarajad
NGOs have access to all beneficiaries women included and can employ women as local NGO personnel in medical programmes in spite of the fact that separation between the sexes has to be strictly observed
For instance ACF employs between and per cent of women in its medical programmes
Medical NGOs play an important role in the professional training of women
They organise medical training sessions for small groups of women in cooperation with the Taleban Ministry of Health
We also carry out Food-for-Work projects
Income-generating activities for women which encourage self-sufficiency are increasingly supported by ECHO
Since ECHO has financed Food-for-Work projects in Kabul for men and women through German Agro Action and Medair from Switzerland
While men are occupied in land recovery works and city drain cleaning women are given raw materials and knitted quilts and sweaters to be distributed to other beneficiaries
This kind of programme entails the participation of women from a variety of socio-economic classes from educated to illiterate women each using their knowledge all manual abilities
They are paid a fixed rate in wheat seed every two weeks
This pilot project in Kabul was subject to an independent evaluation which proved to be very positive
MEDAIR is in the process of implementing a second phase
Similar operations are now funded by ECHO in Mazar Kandahar Herat Kabul and Faizabad through UN Habitat and various NGOs
On other types of project I can inform you that NGOs with the support of ECHO try whenever possible to have women involved in each project
Even in shelter programmes women are involved
Female health monitors go from house to house visiting women in order to provide them with basic information on hygiene primary health care and conservation of water and food
Operational partners such as NGOs international organisations and Red Cross family and UN agencies closely monitor all operations through expatriates and local staff present in the field
All ECHO partners are bound by a framework partnership agreement which obliges them to be present and in relation to us to present financial and operational reports of their activities on a regular basis
Furthermore ECHO has field experts who also follow the ongoing projects very closely to ensure correct delivery of aid
Recently following UN sanctions and meetings in Europe with General Massud the Northern Alliance commander meetings in Europe the hardliners within the Taleban movement seem to be gaining the upper hand as reflected in the hardening of their position against work by women
Unfortunately this general state of affairs is escalating as we can read in press reports now
However in conclusion we can say that despite the difficulties NGOs in Afghanistan are doing their best as our partners to alleviate the suffering of women in the country
ECHO is not carrying out development cooperation as such but is delivering humanitarian aid
Clearly for many Afghans women and men educated and uneducated the activities we support are a valuable and by and large the only form of assistance
Maintaining access for this humanitarian aid is crucial and we will continue our work even if the circumstances are difficult and appear to be worsening at present
I am planning to visit Afghanistan in September with a view to stepping up this effort
Commissioner thank you for your very detailed answer particularly with regard to Afghan women
You know that the President of the European Parliament and some other MEPs too received a delegation from Afghanistan
We very much want to support them and be by their side
Despite your detailed answer I do have to ask you for further information
In France Médecins du Monde has been rallying its efforts over the last few days to alert people about the famine and drought in Afghanistan
Yesterday they came here to Parliament once again
As we know drought is a terrible thing and this drought appears to be the worst in years
We also know that there is no water irrigation system to combat it
Nothing has been done for years there are no dams for example
The situation is terrible and it would now appear that the harvests are down by % a quarter of the population is directly affected by drought and hunger and one million people are heading for the borders
Apparently life in the camps is increasingly dangerous and according to Médecins du Monde food distribution in Afghanistan is extremely erratic
Given this situation I need to be able to respond Commissioner as in the dossier being circulated by its members Médecins du Monde has condemned the fact that the European Union contribution has fallen from million in to million in 
We are therefore moving towards a decrease in aid and assistance to Afghanistan
I would like you to give me an answer on this issue and also to tell me whether given this situation the politics the drought and all the problems that you have mentioned it would not be more crucial to increase our food aid and to put in place a genuine comprehensive policy on humanitarian aid
Even if this exists you did mention this should it not be better coordinated
The problem is that the answer to the drought disaster in Afghanistan would be systematic normal broader-based development cooperation
But the situation in that country does not make it possible to organise and implement normal development cooperation
What we are doing is making a relatively large-scale effort in terms of humanitarian aid
This year ECHO has identified Afghanistan as one of the forgotten conflicts in order to focus on and raise awareness of the need to mobilise international society
It is also clear that the access problem is a real one partly because of politics in Afghanistan
The major challenge we face is to restate and explain the need for everyone involved on both sides of the conflict to accept unhindered access to the country by humanitarian organisations
This will be the focus of my efforts when I go there in September
Subject Commission intentions and actions with regard to the global fund to combat HIVAIDS malaria and tuberculosis While welcoming the increased international attention paid to the tragic and immense consequences of the HIVAIDS epidemic malaria and tuberculosis including the Commission programme for accelerated action in this field it is obvious that there is an urgent need for efforts far beyond this initiative and indeed beyond the pharmaceutical industry lowering of prices in order to address the pressing needs in terms of prevention as well as treatment
The UN Secretary-General recently proposed the establishment of a global fund to combat HIVAIDS malaria and tuberculosis and urged donors to make firm commitments before the UN General Assembly special session on HIVAIDS in June
The amount needed has been estimated at $billion per year
President Bush recently announced an initial US pledge of $ million
In the light of the Commission programme for action what are its intentions as regards the global fund
Is the Commission prepared to take the lead in this issue and contribute significantly to the fund
 The direct answer to the question of whether the Commission will actually contribute money to this fund is that at this stage we do not have an answer
I will try to explain
We made a joint Council and Commission declaration on the proposal for a global health fund at the Development Council meeting on May
I will quote from the first part of this The Council and the Commission note with concern the devastating impact of HIV AIDS and other communicable diseases on human suffering and on economic and social development and hence also on poverty reduction efforts
The proposal by the UN Secretary-General to establish a global HIV AIDS and health fund is therefore fully welcomed
The Commission and Member States will explore how best to develop this initiative
The Commission is taking an active part in the negotiations concerning the modalities and all the issues relating to this fund
There are a number of points we consider important
I will go through them quoting from a speech I made on this issue during the LDC Conference on May
First we would wish to see a number of principles or conditions fulfilled
I will name just a few
One donors should make available additional and new resources over an extended period of time
The Commission does not have access to additional resources
We have a specific budget
The Commission is not in a position to tax directly as you all know
So it is in fact the political decision-makers who decide on taxation who can provide additional resources We cannot
Two the OECD countries need to take measures to assume a fair share of the global financial burden of reducing poverty and disease
Three we do not support single-issue funds and plead for a broad approach targeting the three major communicable diseases malaria tuberculosis and HIV AIDS
Four we will continue to raise the need for country ownership integration with national development strategies and health systems development effective coordination on the ground and keeping prevention efforts to the fore
This is crucial
If all this is not helped by a fund the fund is no help at all
So does it improve delivery
We have had enough empty donor-driven manifestations
If the answer to the question about delivery is not a clear yes the establishment of the fund will only be like crossing the creek to get wet feet
Five a fund should be open to contributions from all interested parties both public and private and should support action beyond the public sector
Six the governing structure of the funds should be light and transparent
The basic and multilaterally agreed health policy principles of WHO should be secured on how it is managed
Seven the fund should be outcome-driven as opposed to input-focused
Eight decreased transaction costs for countries should be a priority
Finally I wish to say that a global fund cannot succeed and will not get our support without a commitment from industry to a global tiered pricing system
These conditions may look very demanding but they represent in fact the mainstream of shared international policy in this area
It would be a tragic mistake to organise a fund which is supposed to be a procurement fund for special expensive types of medicine
Today this is something which we more or less agree upon But that is not how discussion about the fund started out
Much of the discussion so far has been meaningful but please note that as far as mobilising money is concerned today we are not even allowed to provide core funding for UN organisations
Even under the new financial regulation which we hope to get but do not yet have we will not be allowed to carry out normal core funding although we hope to be allowed to provide programme-based funding for UN organisations
This fund however will not be a UN organisation
What is on the cards here is to ensure core funding for this fund
None of this is as easy as it may be portrayed in the press but we are in substance a very active player in contributing to making the fund a meaningful and well-organised entity
Thank you Commissioner Nielson for a very full and in many parts interesting reply
I believe we agree that this is one of the most serious epidemics and not only one of the most serious humanitarian catastrophes but one of the most serious economic catastrophes the world has even seen
As much as ten years ago based on the ways the disease was spread sexual practices of the time and the widespread poverty in many African countries experts were able to make forecasts showing that there would be a spread similar to that which we have today and which has had such incredibly tragic consequences
Unfortunately we are now able to make the same forecasts for other parts of the world which were infected later and the outlook is similar
The only way to proceed is naturally prevention with a mixture of support initiatives for those already affected and preventive initiatives partly in the form of information and education and partly in the form of efforts to find a vaccine
I naturally agree with the Commissioner that no problems will be solved simply by setting up a fund
I also agree with many of the requirements for such a mechanism which Mr Nielson sets out
At the same time it was my experience in setting up UNAIDS of whose board I was a member that we constantly had too little money and were able to implement far too few ambitious initiatives
During the years of setting up the project we actually had no money whatsoever to support the national initiatives in the countries most affected
At the same time as Mr Nielson has stated the UN bodies normal budgets have fallen which means that we are suffering from a major lack of money
I am sure that money is needed to achieve success in terms of research and active initiatives at national level
I therefore believe that Kofi Annan initiative is good as long as this mechanism can be set up in a good and non-bureaucratic way
I appreciate that the Commission cannot conjure up money from nowhere
However there was a major surplus in the EU budget for last year which has recently been returned to the Member States
It must surely have been possible in such an extraordinary situation to gain support from the Council for a substantial aid package
It would otherwise look very strange bearing in mind the Commission very great commitment in the course of last year and the initiative in which Mr Nielson and others were involved in September October 
I would also like to test Mr Nielson a little further
Given that the soundings ahead of the New York Summit in a little under a month time are positive and that this mechanism can be set up properly what plans are there for us in the EU Member States and the EU itself to be able to put forward a decent sum to bolster the preventive work
It is very true that not only is this a human tragedy it is also an economic disaster the mathematics of which are simply paralysing
This is also true in cases where countries choose to opt for treatment
Treating HIV-positive persons may mean that many of them can continue functioning as schoolteachers or whatever
But the treatment is ongoing year after year and the impact on national health budgets even if they are given these anti-retroviral drugs for free is incredible
The real bottleneck in the use of advanced complex medical treatments is not necessarily access to the drugs but the organisation of their delivery
Few people realise that we are talking about to different pills or medications that have to be taken at intervals of a couple of hours around the clock that their composition has to be changed every few weeks and that all of this has to be very strictly and precisely organised
On top of this all these persons need safe drinking water and at least two good varied meals per day
In a developing country that is asking quite a lot
The reality is not so easy
We have been informed that Merck and the Gates Foundation have jointly set up a USD million fund for Lesotho
On top of that Merck has provided free medicine in order to solve the problems of delivery on the ground
They have been working on this for a year without much progress
This is why it is not just an evasive response to lay stress on prevention
We have seen that it can work in the case of Uganda and in other places too we are beginning to see the AIDS curve go down
I appreciate the response from Mr Wijkman
It is true that these organisations need money
We will come to this in the next question
But it will never be the role of the Commission to be a major supplier of general funding as such for the UN organisations
Freeing up additional money for these purposes is the role of the primary donors that is the governments who have the right to tax their citizens
That is how we mobilise additional money
It may also be possible to mobilise new private money
I hope this fund will be a breakthrough by doing so on a systematic basis
As to our own unspent money the fact is not that we have money floating around which we then send back to Member States
The way the system is administratively organised in the case of the European Development Fund is that we call in money on a quarterly basis from the treasuries of the Member States on an ongoing basis
We have real commitments that have not been translated into actions in terms of spending the money
But as I have told Parliament on many occasions we are going through the whole portfolio reducing and scrapping those commitments that are not implementable and accelerating the flow in the pipeline
Most of the money is in principle committed implementation is the real challenge
As you were informed earlier the rate of commitment from now on for AIDS activities will be at the level of about EUR million a year
This shows that in terms of contribution we are a major player and are making a big effort in these countries
The question remains to be answered will we be allowed to do it legally and will this fund actually mean improved ability to deliver on the ground
These are the questions that we need to come back to
The Commissioner will be aware that this Parliament supported the change to the financial regulation which should at least partly ease his path
I should like to ask him two supplementary questions
First as he said in his answer there are many ongoing discussions
We very much welcome the summit that was called by Kofi Annan
We very much welcome his own round table which was organised last year and which made substantial progress at European level
I am aware that there is a proposal for a further such round table jointly between the European Union and US interests
Would the Commissioner comment on whether he feels such a proposal is timely and whether he would be interested in participating in such a meeting
Secondly after the South African case Mr Nielson colleague Mr Lamy did commit European Union technical assistance to developing countries afflicted by the HIV AIDS pandemic to utilise the national emergencies clause in the WTO to examine the use of generic drugs and of parallel importing to secure affordable medicines
Would the Commissioner comment on whether the European Commission has been successful in identifying developing countries to utilise these monies in this way and what further steps he plans to take in order to achieve this
Mr President during the LDC Conference I met with the new administrator of US Aid and I can tell Mr Howitt that the issues he was looking at largely mirrored those I have mentioned today namely prevention of HIVAIDS the real problem being delivery and so on
That was more promising than many other things we hear from his government
It remains to be seen whether the announced contribution of USD million from the US Government to this fund is approved by Congress and whether it will in fact be additional money but that does not form part of our more restricted deliberations here
It is useful to pursue the dialogue with the United States on these issues especially where we could feasibly agree on a practical approach so I will continue working in this vein
As to the second question on using the national emergencies clause as a basis for opening up for some of the elements in the TRIPS Agreement have been sending a clear signal to our partners in the developing world that the Commission is interested in supporting their efforts to find and use the most flexible interpretation of the Agreement and we have also stated as we did at a joint meeting with the CEOs of the major pharmaceutical companies that Pascal Lamy and myself attended that we see a need to check the existing agreement so as to ensure that the interpretation is good enough to facilitate better use of these possibilities in developing countries
However we have not pinpointed any specific cases on which we can focus and act in a concrete manner
That said we have expressed a strong desire to do so
What we have done is to apply pressure by announcing a total untying with regard to all essential drugs used to treat these transmittable diseases
Opening up not only regionally but also globally should make price differentiation more difficult
It should also make for a change in stance from bidders from around the world and from the generic drug producers
Mr President first I would like to thank the Commissioner for his answers today
No one who has listened to the Commissioner over the last few years in this House could doubt his commitment to removing poverty and disease from the world as efficiently and effectively as possible using EU-resources
I wanted to ask him a question about the third disease mentioned in this report and suggest to him that perhaps we should concentrate on this least glamorous of the three because tuberculosis could be eradicated
Unfortunately HIV as you say is likely to be with us for a long time and at the moment we are largely into palliative care as regards HIVAIDS
A concerted world programme over a relatively short period of time could eliminate tuberculosis from the world
I have a particular interest in this because the cure was actually pioneered in my home city of Edinburgh years ago
We thought we had eradicated it in western Europe but it is re-emerging now
If we can remove it from the developing nations we can also remove it from the world permanently
That is the prize the permanent removal which is unfortunately not yet available to us as regards the two other diseases
Even if there is a delay in getting the World Fund going on the other diseases perhaps we could suggest to Kofi Annan and the UN that we have a pilot project concentrating specifically on tuberculosis which might inspire nations to contribute to the other areas once we see success in this area
This is a highly significant point
This is one of the reasons why we have insisted all along it has not always been easy because public attention has been almost exclusively focused on HIVAIDS that malaria TB and HIVAIDS have to be looked at in the same manner
The best economic data we have to illustrate the benefits of doing these things efficiently relate to polio eradication
It has been documented that the world can save USD billion per year in ongoing costs if we can mobilise the USD million it takes for a year final offensive to wipe out the remaining centres of active polio around Nigeria and northern India
It is absolutely feasible and it is an incredible pay-back
As regards TB the mathematics are similar but it is more difficult to eradicate
For TB and malaria the economics of the cure are very different
They cannot in fact be compared to HIVAIDS for which there is no cure only treatment in the mortality rate of HIV-positive persons in the world
If we did what we ought to do for malaria and TB that would bring about as much improvement as we could ever achieve with anti-retrovirals
This is the real issue
There is good reason to give more attention to TB and malaria
This was the main contribution of our action programme
It was also supported by the round table last September
It is exactly for that reason that I am somewhat stubborn about creating such a fund when we are not sure about the modalities and the policy of that fund
I therefore welcome the contribution concerning TB
I will look firstly at the positive changes
It is true that from the Sierra Bardaji report in to the Fantuzzi report in and now the Martin report we have succeeded by means of amendments in this case in improving the situation amendments on distillation which is now compulsory amendments on new planting rights of % on regeneration of vineyards on rest periods for the land on potable alcohols on aid for concentrated must and not merely for the CIII zones which worried my wine growers in Languedoc-Roussillon and those of Raymond Chesa amendments also on inspectors as we had only two inspectors for the whole of Europe and perhaps even on interbranch organisations which go back to Maréchal Pétain and are supported by the Left
But that is not the important point
We may even have made progress in the religious war on dry sugaring
However I fear that other more sinister attitudes are lurking beneath these technical concessions
There are four as far as I can see Malthusianism fundamentalism internationalism and dehumanisation
With regard to Malthusianism firstly as is the case with meat cereal milk and even coal and steel you only ever have one management instrument a drastic cut in supply
You never look into developing demand
It is true that we must prepare for the opening of the wine market to the East with the arrival of Hungarian Romanian and Bulgarian wines and even the World Trade Organisation in the year with our Australian Californian and South African friends
Fundamentalism in this case is the fiscal anti-wine fundamentalism of Northern Europe with euros in excise duty on each litre of wine in Denmark and the United Kingdom
It is the health fundamentalism that is seen in Sweden and Finland where they are lax about drugs but puritans when it comes to alcohol even though wine is a health product with positive cardiovascular effects to say nothing of the mental effects of beer-drinking seen in the hooligans at Heisel
Internationalism is the six million hectolitres of imports a tenth of a euro in customs duties and the famous concentrated musts from third countries that you were preparing to authorise
Fortunately the Commission was able to resist
All that was needed to perfect this internationalism was to authorise wines in bulk and not to authorise bottling in the region of production
This brings me to the fourth and final undesirable effect that of dehumanisation which would make wine an industrial product rather than an agricultural one
This is the source of the conflict between the beer-drinkers of Northern Europe and the wine-drinkers elsewhere in Europe and I fear this must affect the balance in the Council of Ministers
But I would suggest to the House that if there had ever been vines in Saudi Arabia this would have changed the strategic face of the world
I fear there must be some complicity here between the fundamentalism of the North and the fundamentalism of the South since neither of them drink wine
Question Time Commission
The next item is questions to the Commission B
Question No by Paul Rübig H
Subject The euro in textbooks The smooth introduction of the single currency and its acceptance by European citizens will depend to a very great extent on how rapidly and comprehensively information can be provided in the educational sector
Particular attention will of course be paid to educational establishments and subjects which are in general concerned with currency aspects for example commercial colleges and subjects such as accountancy and bookkeeping
Can the representative of the Commission present today say what progress has been achieved in the transition to the euro in the educational sector and in particular in updating textbooks and teaching materials
I should like to welcome Mrs Cresson and ask her to reply to Mr Rübig question
You have the floor Mrs Cresson
The Commission is aware of the major challenge which the transition to the euro represents for the educational sector
Children will play a crucial role in helping parents to adapt to the single currency
While respecting the exclusive competence of the Member States in this area the Commission is supporting several projects within the Socrates programme which are helping to disseminate information on the euro in schools and to integrate this topic into the different curriculum subjects
A number of concrete measures are worth mentioning here
A working group entitled Education and the euro has been set up comprising representatives of the Ministers for Education and the national agencies of the Socrates programme
This group work concerns the promotion of educational initiatives on the euro and the exchange of information and good practice in this area
The work of this group has led notably to the creation of an inventory of educational tools and initiatives on the euro both at national and Community level which is accessible on the Internet on the page entitled The euro at school on the Europa server
A handbook describing Member States initiatives in this area particularly concerning the training of teachers and adaptation of school syllabuses and textbooks is currently being put together
This document will also be available on the Internet and will be distributed to interested parties
Commissioner I should like to ask a supplementary question if this is being offered on the Internet and multimedia information is thus also being made available do you see any chance of this being learning entertainment or a learning adventure which will make it an enjoyable experience for people to learn about this subject because in the end it is also a question of parents finding out from their children what prospects this has to offer for the future
As far as the research programme is concerned I would be interested to know whether there are programmes in the research sector which address the issue of how the euro can best be introduced and what problems might arise when this actually happens so that these can once again be overcome by giving instruction before the event
This activity or action does not directly concern the research sector but rather the education sector As I said we are indeed intending to disseminate information via the Internet which will be designed for schools and will therefore be presented in the most attractive format possible
The idea of designing innovative educational software and games has not been ruled out
Moreover I would point out that every year we carry out a project of Internet and multimedia dissemination during a week of what are known as net days
For the next week of net days which will take place at the beginning of the next school year I will recommend that we introduce the topic of the euro in exchanges which take place between European schools so that this genuinely topical issue can feature in the programmes organised at the time
I also believe that raising the awareness of teachers is absolutely essential
This was already begun three years ago as part of my initiative concerning the use of multimedia and the Internet
As we will have to explain the subject of the euro in greater detail however we can start the ball rolling first with the teachers
That is the information I have on this type of activity
With regard to research at my request and suggestion the structure of the fifth framework programme of research was modified substantially compared with the fourth framework programme and the second main chapter heading now deals with information technology
As in the other chapters of the framework programme within information technology there is a series of key horizontal actions relating to disciplines in both pure sciences and social sciences
With regard to the issue of educational software and multimedia it will also be very useful to be able to introduce incentives and invitations to tender relating to the euro so that we obtain responses to our proposals which we can then disseminate if they are good
Question No by Richard Howitt H
Subject Charges for international bank transfers and the single market in financial services Does the Commission agree with my constituent Mr Vaughan of Rochford that it is unreasonable for UK banks to charge up to GBP for direct transfers to banks in other EU countries when the same function is operated by the Dutch bank ABNAMRO for just NLG GBP 
In a Union where we are trying to abolish barriers to trade and free movement of labour would this high cost of transferring money from one Member State to another not contradict the Commission principles and actively discourage citizens from undertaking work and business in other countries
Will the Commission consider whether the UK banks are thus responsible for anti-competitive behaviour in breach of Article of the Treaty or whether this is indeed a breach of the single market in financial services
I should like to welcome Mr Van Miert and ask him to reply to Mr Howitt question
You have the floor Mr Van Miert
The honourable Member asked first of all whether the level of fees charged by British banks for international money transfers within the European Union could be an infringement of Article of the Treaty of Rome
This famous article outlaws agreements or concerted practices between undertakings in so far as they have a restrictive effect on competition and affect trade between Member States
So as long as the pricing in question is the result of an independent uncoordinated decision of individual banks there is no infringement of Article 
But if something else is going on there might well be a real problem
Secondly the honourable Member asks whether the level of fees in question is a breach of the single market in financial services
In its communication on easier cross-border payments of the Commission stated its view that the full benefits of the single market and economic and monetary union will be achieved only if it is possible for businesses and individuals to transfer money as rapidly reliably and cheaply from one part of the Community to another as is now the case within most Member States
The Commission continues to hold this opinion
However there is no legal base in the Treaty for using legislation to eliminate the higher costs borne by users who are making cross-border as compared with domestic transfers
Indirectly however the Commission has brought pressure to bear on the banking and payments systems concerned notably by proposing a directive on cross-border transfers
This directive has been adopted and is going to enter into force on August 
That proposal has encouraged banks to review their systems and to make them more efficient in order to be able to meet the directive requirements especially on transparency guaranteed time schedules for transfers and the money-back guarantee to senders
There is some evidence that some banks have reduced their prices over the past five years since the proposal came on to the Commission agenda
Pricing policy however is ultimately a matter for the individual service providers whether the transfers are made within one country or between countries
Finally in its Green Paper on the introduction of the single currency the Commission renewed its appeal to banks to treat the introduction of the euro as the golden opportunity to move towards a single payment area at least for euro payments
The Commission is presently reviewing its policy on retail cross-border payments in order to deal amongst others with the issue of what are still significantly higher prices
The situation as it is now is certainly not satisfactory
You can rely on the Commission to continue to work to remedy that
I thank the Commissioner for a very full answer and for agreeing with me that this is an unsatisfactory position
Will he go further and say that the survey showed that most Member States most but not all have low rate and efficient payment systems
Does not the survey by my constituent Mr Vaughan showing that British banks are charging up to three times more than their Dutch counterparts reveal that we have a particular problem in Britain
Will you commit yourself specifically to addressing that problem
When you say that you will continue with voluntary efforts will you take into account the commitments from your own colleagues
Commissioner Monti after he met the European Banking Federation on January said I intend to examine in a communication what remains to be done to improve the functioning of retail payment systems in the single market
Similarly Commissioner de Silguy issued a warning to Europe financial institutions on May urging them to look at this matter again
Will we have more action not just more of the same
As far as the last part of the question is concerned the answer is yes but leave it to us to use the instruments in the best way we can and according to the rules
There should be no doubt about our determination to do so in all respects
As far as the first part of the question is concerned this should also be addressed to the British authorities to find out what is happening in Great Britain
To the extent that it might concern the European Commission including as a competition authority we certainly are prepared to look into it
May I welcome the Commissioner here to the Chamber this evening
May I ask him if he does not agree with me that there is in fact great difficulty in ensuring the transparency of the cost of transfers until such time as the euro applies in each Member State
Would he also agree with me that there is a lack of choice of financial intermediaries within the United Kingdom to access venture capital particularly for small and medium-sized companies
I feel great concern which I would like to place on record that to access loans through the European Investment Bank there is only a choice of one intermediary in the United Kingdom
Is there anything the Commissioner or the British authorities can do to stimulate competition in this field
As far as the intermediaries are concerned if you could give us some more evidence we would be certainly prepared to look into that
It is also related to the responsibilities of my colleague Mario Monti but again we are certainly open-minded about it and will look into whatever evidence you might make available to us
For the rest I am puzzled to learn that there is such a big difference between the transfer fees which are still applied in Great Britain and some other European countries
There must be an explanation for that though as far as I can see it would be very difficult to come up with a satisfactory explanation
Something must be done about it
As I mentioned earlier it is also a reason for the British authorities either to take action or to look into what is really happening
But there should be no doubt that as we see it the present situation is largely unsatisfactory
Question No by Willy De Clercq H
Subject Major national differences in respect of recognition recognition procedure classification of and controls on medicinal products Completion of the Internal Market still seems a long way off as far as medicinal products are concerned
Companies are experiencing difficulties in having new medicinal products recognised in the various Member states because of differences in recognition procedures and in exactly what is classified as a medicinal product
It is not only companies but consumers too who suffer as a result
In some Member States patients can use a particular product but not in others
Furthermore the different controls in the Member states are often the source of legal uncertainty and of inadequate protection
Nor is this an adequate means of guaranteeing safety for patients
What progress has been achieved with completion of a uniform and harmonised market within the EU for pharmaceuticals and what action does the Commission intend to take in the short term
I should like to welcome Mr Papoutsis and ask him to reply to Mr De Clercq question
You have the floor Commissioner
Mr President there has been considerable progress made with regard to the internal market for medicinal products
The picture presented by Mr De Clercq in this respect fully reflects the reality of the situation as it was several years ago
However since major steps have been taken leading to considerable progress being achieved in bringing about a single market the technical harmonisation of which is almost completed
In broad terms what is being pursued in this sector can be broken down into three strategic action plans the development of a European procedure for the granting of permits for the circulation of such products the development of a high level of protection of intellectual property rights and the development of the medicinal products market itself
As regards the granting of permits for the distribution of medicinal products in two new Community procedures were launched which today allow us swift access to the European market as a whole by means of a single procedure
This procedure is based either on a joint central assessment carried out by the European Agency for the Evaluation of Medicinal Products resulting in the granting of a single distribution permit issued by the European Commission or on mutual recognition amongst Member States resulting in the harmonisation of national distribution permits
As regards intellectual property rights I must say that through legislation adopted by Community institutions Europe now has available the most adequate provisions worldwide in respect of medicinal products
The legislation adopted in by Community institutions made it possible to safeguard innovations in the biotechnology sector by issuing patent certificates thereby putting an end to the uncertainty plaguing this particular sector
Furthermore the procedure for the granting of distribution permits protects the data that is used in such requests for six or more generally ten years
The third aspect of this strategy for developing the internal market in medicinal products is the development of the single market itself and more especially the development of the principles of free movement and competition in the context of economic regulation in this sector in which products are subject to strict checks in terms of pricing and returns
In May the Single Market Council adopted provisions regarding the development of a single market in medicinal products
In November the Commission made a statement on these issues in the form of a communication which deals with a survey conducted into the progress made thus far in constructing a single market for medicinal products
Mr De Clercq has asked a question which relates to the existence in the near future of plans to improve the operation of the internal market
I can assure you that the Commission has already made a number of proposals in the realm of so-called orphan drugs in other words drugs for rare diseases and also in relation to a more effective regulatory framework for clinical tests
The debate on the single market in medicinal products will continue
Last year in its communication the Commission emphasised the importance of a more rational approach which would be supported in the market towards a regulatory framework in the pharmaceutical sector
The aim is to improve patients access to quality drugs and to improve the competitiveness of the pharmaceutical industry
Thank you for that reply I will check it with those who requested me to ask the question
Question No by Ludivina García Arias H
Subject Neutrality of the Commission Director-General for Energy Does the Commission not believe that the remarks made by its Director-General for Energy a Spanish national during the debate organised by the European Energy Foundation on the implementation of the energy directive in Spain constitute an intervention in respect of the texts enlarging on and interpreting Article of Directive EC on the arrangements governing the transition to competition and that serious doubts therefore arise concerning his neutrality as regards the legality of the imputation of the costs of the transition to competition relating to the Spanish electricity sector
I give the floor to Mr Papoutsis to answer Mrs García Arias question
I regret to have to say Commissioner that the first part of your answer is not an accurate account of what actually took place
I was myself present at the European Energy Foundation dinner together with a number of other journalists
In the light of some of the things said on that occasion I began to feel that as a Spaniard I was betraying my country
However other journalists present confirm what has since been made public and I agree with them As I said I was myself present at the dinner
In addition I now have serious doubts as to the neutrality impartiality and objectivity with which the Director-General for Energy is dealing with this issue
By his very presence at that meeting and by what he said there he endorsed the legality of the costs of transition to competition in Spain
I should like to put a specific question to you Commissioner in view of the fact that this appointment has provoked a mixed reaction in Spain
In fact it has led to much debate is being challenged in the courts as unconstitutional and the consumers associations have lodged appeals in the hope of ensuring that the procedure is carried through in an objective manner
Would you be prepared Commissioner to meet with representatives of the consumers and of the political parties in Spain who are opposed to the procedure chosen to deliver this aid
Mr President I would like to stand firm on what I have already said
The cost of transition towards competitiveness is something which the Commission services are investigating thoroughly under conditions of absolute confidentiality
Neither I nor any other Member of the Commission would wish to second-guess the outcome of these investigations in strict compliance with the provisions of the Treaty which insist on the confidentiality of this process
For this reason we will leave no stone unturned in our attempt to achieve an objective neutral and substantive assessment of this particular case
All of us the Commission of course the Directors-General and all the Members of the Commission have a duty to remain neutral and objective in assessing the various cases
I would like to assure all the political parties in Spain that this is the line the Commission will continue to take
The cost of the transition to a competitive market will not be taken from public funds
It will be borne by the consumers and will constitute an additional element of the price of electricity used
My question relates to the nature of the costs
However further to Mrs García Arias comments I should like to say that I too was present at that dinner and I agree entirely with you Commissioner as to the neutrality of the Director-General
It is quite usual for senior officials from the Commission to attend dinners
It would be much stranger if you did not allow them to go
Furthermore we all want to hear what they have to say
I am also quite sure that you all operate discretely and maintain confidentiality
My question however is this is the cost we are discussing state aid
Or is it an additional element of the price of electricity which will simply be absorbed like any other since it is a result of investments made to guarantee energy and to guarantee supply in tightly regulated and controlled markets
I would like to assure you that following discussions held with the Commission both with me and with my colleague Mr Van Miert the Spanish Government has accepted that the Spanish case be looked into
This will allow our services to investigate as is proper and in accordance with the rules whether these are indeed costs relating to the obligations of the public services which were previously imposed by the public authorities on their own corporations and which are now being imposed on the process to free up the market and which run the risk of causing casualties among the companies involved
These are the boundaries within which the matter is being handled
For the time being I have nothing more to add and under no circumstances will I seek to pre-empt the conclusion which our services will come to
What I can do however is reassure you yet again that in carrying out their assessment our services will abide by the principle of absolute neutrality and will simply assess the facts on their merits
I would also like to point out that this procedure is closely bound up with the operation of the internal market for energy and as such it must be a litmus test for the credibility of the system
This is one more reason for the Commission to stand firm on the impartiality of the procedure
It will be for the Commission to consider whether the so-called costs of the transition to a competitive situation are genuine costs and should be included in the electricity bill or whether on the contrary they are to be seen as state aid
I must take this opportunity to mention that prior to this debate the government had refused to raise the matter with the Commission
Secondly I wish to put a question along the lines of that raised by Mrs García Arias concerning Mr Benavides attitude
I find it quite unacceptable and I feel personally insulted
Mr Benavides reference to political exhibitionism can only be understood as a reference either to members of the Spanish Parliament or to Members of this Parliament and I find any such reference totally unacceptable
I must also remind Mr Papoutsis that very soon when the common market for energy becomes a reality all issues relating to energy and this one in particular will come within the Commission competence
In this context I have to make it quite clear that in my judgment in our judgment Mr Benavides has forfeited the impartiality and objectivity which are essential when dealing with an issue of this nature
Mr President allow me to give my assurances yet again to the honourable Member and to this House that I personally and the services within the Commission will do our utmost to ensure that the directive to create the internal market in electricity is implemented in the most neutral and impartial way possible
Let me reiterate that what is at issue here is the credibility of the operation of the internal market system and the responsibilities assumed by the Commission in implementing this directive
On this basis therefore I would ask that you respect the answer I gave before regarding the Director-General for Energy
Mr President in line with Parliament rules and the conditions governing the conduct of its proceedings the honourable Member will receive the same answer I gave to Mrs García Arias in writing as provided for in the Rules of Procedure
Thank you for those answers Mr Papoutsis and for attending Question Time
Question No by Jan Andersson H
Subject Conditions for Swedish adoption of the common currency The introduction of the euro at the beginning of the year has lent urgency to the debate in Sweden on its possible future adoption of the common currency the timing of which is one of the principal issues
Here it would be valuable to clarify the formal criteria for adopting the euro
Can the Commission explain how the present qualifying periods for joining the ERM are to be interpreted
Are they irrevocable and absolute or are there circumstances which might be invoked for allow Sweden to join the ERM at an earlier date than that implied by the qualifying periods laid down for the ERM
I give the floor to Mr de Silguy to answer Mr Andersson question
In reply to Mr Andersson I would like to say firstly that the Treaty does not specify any qualifying period for the passage of a Member State to the third stage of economic and monetary union
I would remind you that in accordance with Article k which lays down the procedure for entry into EMU for Member States with a derogation the Commission and the European Central Bank must report to the Council at least once every two years or at the request of the Member State concerned
So to enter the third stage of economic and monetary union it is necessary to have achieved a high degree of sustainable convergence
This is what the Treaty says
The Commission examines the following criteria here the achievement of a high degree of price stability the sustainability of the government financial position in terms of both deficits and debt and the observance for at least two years of the normal fluctuation margins provided for by the exchange rate mechanism of the European Monetary System
The sustainability of convergence achieved by the Member State and of its participation in the exchange rate mechanism of the European Monetary System are also reflected in the long-term interest rate levels
With regard to Sweden the Commission considered in its report of March that this country did not fulfil the necessary conditions for the adoption of the single currency
Firstly Sweden national legislation including the statute of the national central bank was not compatible with Articles and of the Treaty and the Statute of the European System of Central Banks
Secondly Sweden did not fulfil the criterion of exchange rate stability
The Swedish krona never participated in the exchange rate mechanism and in addition in the two years under review by the Commission and the Swedish krona fluctuated against the ERM currencies reflecting among other things the absence of an exchange rate target
With regard to the criterion of exchange rate stability set out in the third indent of Article j of the Treaty the Commission considered in its report last March that the currencies of Finland and Italy although having rejoined the ERM only in October and November respectively had displayed sufficient stability in the last two years
In conclusion I would say that there is no qualifying period and I would point out again that the conditions of entry for the Member States that are today the pre-ins are the same as for the countries that are currently participating in economic and monetary union
I should like to begin by thanking the Commissioner for his reply
I put the question because the main reason why Sweden decided not to join EMU was that public opinion was against it
Now I can safely say that public opinion in Sweden has changed dramatically
According to the latest polls a large majority of Swedish people are in favour of the euro and of joining the single currency
This means that next year or perhaps a little later Sweden will hold a referendum to decide whether to join the single currency
I should therefore be grateful if there could be some flexibility over the timetable for entry
In the past year the Swedish Parliament has decided on the position of the central bank
Consequently I believe that we are now seeing a period of more stability
I am therefore once again putting the question to the Commissioner
The most important aspects should still be Sweden economy and its eligibility for a place in the club in terms of inflation interest rates and so on
In this respect the situation looks fairly promising
I have already had the opportunity to comment on this subject and I pointed out that there are only two countries which have an opt-out facility under the Treaty and these are Denmark and the United Kingdom
It is obvious that we are not going to force a country manu militari to adopt a single currency if it does not wish to do so
As for the rest I very much hope that the economic and political advantages of membership of the single currency that we are currently observing will be able to sway opinions in the countries which do not belong today
I hope that opinions will be changed quickly and the excellent stability programme presented yesterday by the Swedish Government and accepted by the Council of Ministers is an encouraging factor here
However I would add that the exchange rate criterion is important
It has legal force and will therefore be applied under precisely the same conditions
I will gladly forward to Mr Andersson a copy of the speech I made yesterday concerning the Swedish Government convergence programme
I should just like to make sure that we have understood the reply correctly
The background to this issue is as follows The French Minister for Europe in a leading article in a Swedish newspaper recently described his perception of Sweden attitude to the euro under the heading A stronger euro if Sweden joins
He also said that Sweden was perfectly entitled not to join the single currency for the time being
As my Swedish colleague mentioned earlier the situation has now changed significantly
I believe it would be a very good thing in view of the new positive attitude that currently prevails if the Swedish people were to feel that the present members of the single currency were keen for their country to join
I should just like to confirm that the Commissioner and the French Minister for Europe are both agreed on that point
It is not my place to comment on any statements or articles by European Union ministers
What I can say is that the Commission obviously hopes that Sweden together with the other countries which are not participating in economic and monetary union will join or be in a position to join the euro zone as quickly as possible because our analysis shows that this is in the interest of the countries in question and in the interest of the EU as a whole
Question No by Astrid Thors H
Subject The Target payment system The new Target system for payment transactions between European banks was put into practice in connection with the transition to the euro at the beginning of this year
The system has at least during the initial phase been extremely unsatisfactory and caused considerable delays to payments between EU banks
Delays in payment have resulted in substantial losses for the banks
According to the Commission which measures are needed in order to guarantee that the new Target system will facilitate the banks transactions instead of making them more difficult as is now the case
I give the floor to Mr de Silguy to answer Mrs Thors question
Mr President the Target payment system comes within the competence of the European System of Central Banks which operates it
It is not therefore the Commission responsibility to deal with matters concerning the operation of Target nor is it my place to advise the ESCB on the matter
Nevertheless the Commission has read the various reports describing the initial difficulties encountered by the system
I assure you that these difficulties are rare and limited and that they in no way represent functional defects
According to the Commission information Target itself has posed hardly any problems and seems to have operated normally from the first day of use
The difficulties mentioned are more likely to result from the inexperience of certain commercial banks which is only to be expected in the early stages of using a new system
For example these banks have input data that are incompatible with the system it has also been the case that out of habit certain banks have concentrated most of their transactions in the latter part of the day thus giving rise to bottlenecks
Finally it has been necessary to bring the national payment systems links particularly computer interfaces into line with Target which also explains the teething problems noted
However given the scale and complexity of the system these difficulties appear to be minor and the European System of Central Banks now seems to have them completely under control
This is illustrated by a press release of January in which the European Central Bank indicated that the problems encountered with the cross-border flow of liquidity during the first few days of the euro area money market had diminished substantially and that overall only three weeks after its creation the market had reached a satisfactory level of integration
Mr President Commissioner I quite agree with you
I think you have explained that the problems I asked about were really just teething troubles
I think it is important to note that part of the problem stems from the fact that some systems do not operate throughout the day This means that there is a great deal of payment activity at the end of the day
Is the Commission aware of the continuing existence of this problem
According to my information the situation at the end of January was that some banks were still not connected to the Target system throughout the day
That is why the problem has arisen
I should also like to ask whether the Commission has taken part in any discussions regarding the question of compensation that has arisen as a result of the delays
It was my understanding that in certain circumstances the compensation issue was to be addressed
Consequently I should like to thank the Commissioner for his written reply about another matter which I received this morning
Mr de Silguy we are supported by interpreters in the House and the Spanish booth at least had not completed the interpretation of Mrs Thors speech in Swedish
I was obviously anxious to hear the speech in full and would therefore remind you to wait until you are given the floor
I have no wish to flaunt my authority
I am merely concerned for the smooth running of proceedings
You now have the floor to respond to Mrs Thors supplementary question
I apologise Mr President interpretation may be quicker in one language than in another
In any case I congratulate Mrs Thors on her French
I certainly cannot speak in Swedish or Finnish
On the two aspects you raised Mrs Thors I must point out firstly that this was an extremely complex and cumbersome system and that the difficulties encountered were negligible compared to what could have happened although all preparations had been made
Once again it is a question of habit
You referred to payments made at the end of the day this is also a question of habit and all these problems will disappear as the market becomes integrated and begins to operate more smoothly
I believe that now only small technical or electrical problems occur occasionally but these are dealt with quickly and I believe in everyone best interests
In any case the system works
Secondly when the system was introduced the Commission had to deal with certain aspects which fell within its jurisdiction for example issues related to competition which might have posed a problem when the system was set up
These have now been resolved and are once again the responsibility of the European Central Bank you could ask Mr Duisenberg this question at the next opportunity
As the author is not present Question No lapses
Question No by Anna Terrón i Cusí H
Subject Excessive commissions charged by Spanish banks Is the Commission aware that on the pretext of the introduction of the euro Spanish banks are charging excessive commissions for exchanging eurocurrencies ranging from % to % in the case of sums less than Pta 
Does the Commission believe these practices are likely to make the public more enthusiastic about the advent of the euro
I give the floor to the Commissioner to answer Mrs Terrón question
These two questions are very much related and it is difficult to separate them because they rightly raise the problem of the cost of banking transactions now that the euro has been introduced
This is a vitally important issue for the Commission because the acceptance of the euro by the general public depends on it
We must make the situation clear and distinguish between national banking transactions and cross-border transactions within the euro zone
With regard to national transactions on April the Commission adopted a recommendation providing both for equal treatment of the euro and the national currency and for compulsory transactions to be free of charge
In accordance with this principle all banking services must cost the same whether the sum is in euros or in the national currency
On this point as far as we know breaches of the recommendation are quite rare
The situation regarding cross-border transactions on the other hand is different
There are both manual foreign-exchange operations exchanging notes for notes and cross-border transfers
In the Commission opinion a clear and detailed presentation of the level and structure of bank charges for both types is essential to promote competition and thus a reduction in the commission charged which would be of great benefit to the consumer
The exchange rate risk has disappeared with the advent of the euro
The conversion rate between currencies in the euro zone has been fixed irrevocably thus preventing the use of spread which means different buying and selling rates
But the euro does not eliminate all costs for example certain handling or transaction costs
In total according to our information and our calculations the birth of the euro should represent an average saving of approximately % on transaction costs in comparison to the period prior to its introduction and this should of course logically be passed on to the customer
With regard more specifically to cross-border payment systems for small sums the introduction of the euro does not automatically unify these systems
They will therefore continue to operate independently in accordance with the structure of the national systems
The issue of manual exchange will by definition be resolved definitively on January but there will be no automatic progress with regard to transfers
For this reason we must aim as soon as possible to create a Target system for the public so that transfers of small sums these being of interest to individuals whereas the Target system which we were just discussing is of interest to the banks between countries in the euro zone are carried out as securely and quickly as national transfers and at a similar cost
That is the situation
In the light of this the Commission has taken a number of measures to encourage banks to facilitate use of the euro by reducing excessive bank charges
Firstly the banks are called upon to increase transparency
To this end they must publish the structure of the bank charges that they have applied since January 
Ireland for example has published notices on this issue in the national press and I believe this sets an example for other countries
The European banking federations must submit a complete overview to the Commission by March at the latest and at that time the Commission will undertake a full evaluation of the situation
Secondly the Commission has just set up a fax and e-mail system known as eurosignal which the public can contact directly it has also published e-mail addresses in the press so that people can send messages and we guarantee to reply to every single one of them
Thirdly the Member States are called upon to quickly set up euro monitoring centres as the Commission has recommended
Finally the Commission has encouraged the banks to develop the cross-border payment systems that I have just mentioned which are safe fast efficient and at a reasonable cost
In spring the Commission will publish a communication which will allow us to bring all this together and to propose a framework for creating a single payments area
This communication will examine both existing methods of payment cards cheques and future methods and here I am referring to the electronic wallet
My aim is that this summer all tourists and God knows there are plenty in Europe will realise that the euro makes it cheaper for them in than it was last year to travel to another European country and to exchange money
The Commission has not delayed in taking action it is determined to achieve a real improvement in the situation and this must be visible by this summer at the latest
Thank you Commissioner for your detailed account of planned developments in the euro zone but I had put a specific question to you
Are you aware that on January all the financial institutions in Spain simultaneously began to charge high commissions on the purchase of currencies that are part of the euro
This development and the fact that all the institutions took action simultaneously lead us to suspect that some agreement on this policy must have been reached in advance Clearly any such agreement would contravene the basic rules of the market
Commissioner you claimed that tourists will find it cheaper to travel within the euro zone this summer
However tourists who come to Spain and try to change spending money may find that they lose up to % of the money they change and with no prior warning
Are you aware of the situation and do you intend to introduce specific measures to remedy it
To give you further details I can tell you that Mr Van Miert is going to speak before the Subcommittee on Monetary Affairs next week
I am sure that for the specific case you have mentioned he will be able to provide you with all the information that you require and that can be given
I would also assure you that the Commission will fully assume its responsibility and will apply the powers it holds in accordance with the Treaty
Finally we have been in direct and constant contact with the banks for one and a half months now precisely in order to help advance the situation
I think we are currently making progress
We could not hope to resolve everything on the first day
I believe that from now on the whole of the banking sector will be more aware of what is happening and the situation has already improved in a great many cases
I hope that this will become more widespread in the weeks and months to come
You will recall Commissioner that when this House approved the report on the euro and the consumer for which I myself was the rapporteur it also approved a recommendation to the effect that the Commission should put forward legislation designed to eliminate or curtail such practices
Unfortunately this never happened and so unfortunately events have shown that we were right and we are now having to raise our voices and complain on behalf of consumers about current practices in the various countries
These practices are preventing the citizen the consumer from appreciating fully that the euro has arrived and that charges should therefore disappear
The Bank of Spain is to be commended for its initiative to provide free exchange of all currencies from within the so-called euro zone in Spain
Unfortunately however the Bank of Spain network is limited and this initiative has not prevented the private banking institutions from pursuing a policy which may well have been agreed in advance
If that proved to be the case I am sure Mr Van Miert would have something to say about it
In any case our misgivings as to possible abuses of this nature have proved well founded
Firstly I believe we should not generalise certain cases which have arisen
Secondly it must be understood that the Commission does not have the necessary legislative powers to compel banks and bureaux de change by regulatory means to exchange notes free of charge or to observe a maximum tariff
This also applies to charges on cross-border transfers
The Commission ensures that banks observe the existing legal obligations conversion between the euro and the national currency unit without charge conversion of accounts to the euro unit without charge and non-discrimination between the euro and the national currency unit in charges for identical services
Furthermore the measures we have taken are currently leading to progress in this area
I have already said this and I will say it again I believe that what happened at the beginning was overexposed in the media
We must not generalise this at EU level
We must be vigilant
This is why we are maintaining pressure on the banks and this pressure must be translated into action
If in fact no change is observed at the end of a reasonable period we might have to consider alternative measures
But I do not believe that we have reached this stage yet the results of measures undertaken in recent weeks lead us to believe that the situation is improving
It took forty years to put this single currency into circulation so we should not expect the obstacles and constraints encountered by our citizens and consumers to disappear all at once
Also these obstacles are not generally linked to the currency itself but result from other factors for example the links between banking systems
I can therefore assure you once again that the Commission is aware of the problems and we are being vigilant
We are working in close cooperation with the banks and consumers and we have issued a number for dealing with complaints and any difficulties that arise
We will answer all calls
Like you Commissioner I believe in European integration and I certainly believe that we have taken a historic step forward
Furthermore millions of euros are in fact being spent on campaigns to inform the citizens about future developments which will benefit them in two years time
Nevertheless the citizens have had to put up with being charged commission by the banks from the very first day of trading and there is a sneaking suspicion that the banking institutions may have come to an agreement
This is quite feasible as there are not many of them
I do not therefore believe that we can dismiss these as just a few isolated cases seized on by the media
In practice when an ordinary citizen travels he is forced to part with a commission
Do you not think that a public statement might be called for Commissioner
I understand that you have been in contact with the banks but could you not give a more helpful response to the citizens who have complained
I believe I have already answered all the points you raised except one
You asked if I could not do so publicly
We have done so on February we published an extremely detailed press release dealing with the questions you have raised
I will pass this press release on to you very shortly and I will be distributing it to the whole of Parliament to show that we are dealing with this issue
I will bear in mind however as these debates are of especial interest to me that Spain has been particularly affected
Question No by Christine Oddy H
Subject Amnesty International and the European Union human rights policy Is the Commission aware that Amnesty International has marked the th Anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights with the publication of a report on EU human rights policy
What steps is the European Commission taking to evaluate this report with a view to using its main recommendations to flesh out EU human rights policy
I should like to welcome Mr van den Broek and ask him to reply to Mrs Oddy question
You have the floor Commissioner
I am pleased to confirm that the Commission has received the report to which the honourable Member refers
This report by Amnesty International contains a number of interesting proposals which warrant closer examination
This is why the Commission has invited Amnesty and a number of other human rights organisations to exchange their views on this with members of the interservice group of the Committee on Human Rights which includes representatives from all the relevant Directorates-General
I would also point out here that in our external human rights policy a subject which we have discussed on several occasions in Parliament the European Union is certainly very active
Where I believe we need to step up our efforts is on the proposals to focus our attention on human rights situations within the European Union itself
In this connection I should also like to refer once again to the Treaty of Amsterdam the human rights paragraphs of which were the subject of lengthy debate during negotiations
There is also a proposal by the German Presidency circulating at present to draw up a charter of human rights
We will be discussing this tomorrow with representatives of the Council of Europe in particular in order to see how this initiative should relate to the existing European Convention on Human Rights
To return to external human rights policy I would remind you of the important declaration in Vienna by the Council of Ministers in connection with the th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights
This declaration also announces a number of initiatives and studies in the field of human rights policy one of which I should particularly like to mention which is the suggestion that we should consider whether the European Union should draw up its own annual human rights report something that the European Parliament has also called for
Finally I should like to point out that the Commission feels that if we are to take such a far-reaching initiative it could be very important to opt for an annual report which deals with a limited number of human rights themes rather than perhaps seeking to produce a worldwide report
Apart from the human and financial resources which would be required the US State Department already issues such a report
I fear that otherwise we will simply be duplicating their work
All these initiatives are currently being discussed a fact which we welcome
I would say to Mrs Oddy that we have the very definite feeling that interest in human rights issues is not only widening but also deepening in the European Union which is most definitely to be welcomed
I thank the Commissioner for his helpful response
As this is such a broad subject I will just devote myself to one area On the EU code of conduct on the arms trade is there yet a common list of military equipment covered by that code
How many countries have refused export licences for arms
And how are you monitoring that Member States are carrying out their duties under this code properly
Mrs Oddy will recall that under the British Presidency agreement was finally reached on a code of conduct for arms exports that of course the content of this agreement was the result of a compromise between the Member States on a difficult issue which has been the subject of discussion for so many years and that the German Presidency has resolved to see whether the terms of this code of conduct can be further tightened up to allow stricter controls on arms exports
We must await the outcome of this but it goes without saying that the European Commission strongly supports these efforts
Thank you Commissioner
Please remain with this question
Mr Truscott has the floor to put a supplementary
In welcoming the recent legislative changes in Latvia and Estonia to expedite the naturalisation process for non-citizens born in these countries does the Commission believe further measures are necessary under the Copenhagen human rights criteria to allow the full integration of Russian speakers in Latvia and Estonia
The Council and Commission both welcomed the legislation to facilitate naturalisation which was recently adopted in Estonia and Latvia
I believe I am right in saying that in the past we insisted on compliance with the recommendations of the OSCE High Commissioner for national minorities and on this point and particular in relation to stateless children these recommendations have been met
What we are currently monitoring more closely on the basis of cooperation and constructive dialogue with these countries is the situation regarding the language regime for minorities and the language knowledge requirements in order to stand as candidates in national or regional elections
But I believe there is every reason to be optimistic as the politically difficult decisions taken in this area fortunately particularly in the case of Latvia received very broad support in a referendum on the issue
Mr van den Broek you spoke about an EU charter of fundamental rights but all the Member States have incorporated human rights into their own constitutions and there are also international rules on human rights so what would the EU achieve through having a special EU charter on human rights
This is an interesting question in itself
It is also the reason why I said earlier that we need to take a careful look at what this charter could mean in terms of strengthening human rights within the Union
The honourable Member is quite correct apart from the national constitutions of the Member States which generally provide sufficient protection for fundamental rights and freedoms there is also the Council of Europe European Convention on Human Rights which is still unique including in the sense that it is the only human rights convention in the world which also includes an enforcement mechanism on the basis of which a separate court in Strasbourg can be asked to pronounce on violations and infringements of the convention
Taking all this into account the honourable Member will also remember that there has already been an in-depth debate on whether or not it would be possible to allow the European Community to be a party to the European Convention on Human Rights as a legal personality
The Court of Justice in Luxembourg ruled that this was not possible on the basis of the present EU Treaty
So if this is out of the question it then raises the question of how else human rights protection can be regulated at European level perhaps including powers for the Court of Justice
That is the debate currently on the agenda but as I said we are also having discussions with the Council of Europe
We will certainly keep you informed of the progress of these discussions
Question No by Giorgos Dimitrakopoulos H
Subject Security in Cyprus Given that the EU and some Member States in particular had raised objections to the initial plan of the Cyprus Government to site a surface-to-air missile system consisting of Smissiles on the island and subsequently congratulated it on its decision to cancel the plan how does the Commission feel that Cyprus should improve its security
I give the floor to the Commissioner to answer Mr Dimitrakopoulos question
My expert colleagues have prepared a long answer to Mr Dimitrakopoulos question
With all due respect for everything this contains which I am sure Mr Dimitrakopoulos is already perfectly familiar with I would like to try to give him a rather more off-the-cuff reply I agree with him entirely that the developments in Cyprus have had a positive effect in that President Clerides decision not to place air defence missiles on the island has considerably helped to ease tensions and not only on Cyprus it has also reduced tensions which were in danger of escalating between Greece and Turkey which could in turn have put further strain on relations between the European Union and Turkey
We also know that we are engaged in an intensive process of cooperation with Cyprus with a view to accession
I believe that this wise and courageous decision by President Clerides has created a better climate for that process
Thirdly and this is not the least important point the honourable Member will be aware that the European Union both the Council and the Commission are intensively supporting the efforts by the UN Secretary General and more particularly the special representative Mr Herkus who is on the island at present to try to make progress towards a political solution for Cyprus
Here too we can say that the process was certainly not made any easier as long as the threat of conflict over the air defence missiles was in the air
The positive step taken by President Clerides at the expense of internal political tensions within his government was not only a wise but also a courageous act
But what does this mean for the whole political development of Cyprus as such
Although I cannot be very optimistic there are not enough positive indications that the political process under UN supervision will bring concrete results in the foreseeable future for that it must be said that it has increased the prospect that for example the dialogue on security and the military situation on the island which is being conducted in the form of confidential diplomacy by the United Nations will have a greater chance of success
The honourable Member can be sure that the European Union will try to contribute where we see such chances developing through the presidency Member States contacts and also the European Commission
To conclude this answer we all know what an enormous positive contribution would be made to Cyprus integration in the European Union if a solution could be found to the still fundamental problems that exist on the island
I would like to thank the Commissioner for his spontaneous reply and of course his colleagues
There are a couple of other things I would like to ask
Firstly can the Commissioner give us any evidence of the gestures that we have been expecting from the other side from Turkey and which were previously contained in the Commission communication on the issue of the S-s
Secondly the Commissioner continually used the hypothetical word if
I would like to ask him what course of action the Commission intends to take if what he is expecting to happen does not happen in light of the political solutions which the Commission considers to be vital for the security of Cyprus
When I speak of expectations my answer must always be conditional in the sense that positive steps may of course be expected from two parties when it comes to solving political conflicts
I have clearly stated what President Clerides contribution has been
It could therefore also be expected especially when the security situation on the island itself and here I am speaking of matters such as the militarisation or demilitarisation of the island is so closely linked to President Clerides decision that it would be extremely welcome and we must now urge the Turkish Cypriot community and thus also Ankara to move forward on this very issue
Mr Herkus too has made great efforts recently to see whether it is possible to progressively demilitarise the island also given the very positive boost which that would give to the rest of the political talks which as the honourable Member well knows are at present at a serious impasse
Once again wherever the European Union including the European Commission can give encouragement in its contacts with the Turkish Government it will certainly do so
I believe we must also be realistic enough to recognise that Turkey is at present on the eve of parliamentary elections which is not a period when it is customary to see the most courageous political acts
But let us hope that when the elections are over we will again see new opportunities opening up
Thank you Commissioner
I must make a further demand on your time because in accordance with the Rules Mr Hatzidakis has asked for the floor to put a supplementary question
Mr Hatzidakis now has the floor for one minute and his will be the last question to Mr van den Broek today
Commissioner I would like to ask you two things
Firstly the Cypriot Government previously put forward a proposal to completely demilitarise the island which was rejected by the Turkish Cypriots wrongly in my view
But now the Cypriot Government has put forward a new proposal to establish a NATO peacekeeping force on the island and to bring about the withdrawal of the Turkish forces of occupation and the Greek armed forces from the island
What is your position on this
Secondly in the light of the positive gestures made by the Cypriot Government and given that it has put a stop to its plan to install the S-s and since it has said that the Turkish Cypriots should participate in discussions concerning the membership of Cyprus in the EU which the Turkish Cypriots have refused to do and in the light of the more general mood of conciliation within the Cypriot Government do you not think that the Commission and Council should now make an unequivocal statement that Cyprus will join the EU notwithstanding the stance of the Turkish Cypriots and their participation or otherwise in the negotiations
It is not exactly the business of the European Commission to state whether or not it is desirable to replace the present UN contingent on Cyprus with a larger peacekeeping force However I am convinced that if the parties could agree at some point on the terms for demilitarisation and if the UN Secretary General special representative should deem it useful and necessary to comply with the desire for a UN peacekeeping force then it would certainly then be discussed on the Security Council
A decision would have to be taken at that point
I do not therefore believe that the problem lies in the international community reluctance to make a contribution in whatsoever form
But there must of course be a basic agreement in principle between the parties themselves
As regards the negotiations you know the Commission position We have said time and time again these negotiations have been going on for nine or ten months now that now is not the time to talk about what the situation will be if the negotiations end without a political solution to the problem of the divided island
We do not believe it is productive to speculate on this at present and will therefore refrain from doing so
At the same time the Commission has done all that is necessary to keep the momentum of the negotiations going and will continue to do this if the situation remains as it is at present
Thank you Mr van den Broek
As I indicated ladies and gentlemen that brings us to the end of the time set aside for questions to Mr van den Broek
Questions Nos to will therefore receive written answers
As the authors are not present Questions Nos and lapse
Question No by Alex Smith H
Subject Nuclear waste mismanagement Has the Commission examined the report on nuclear waste mismanagement at UK nuclear sites drawn up by the Nuclear Installations Inspectorate and released in December which sets out how the incompetent management of solid radioactive waste at Dounreay and Sellafield may affect the health of UK citizens and the environment of other EU Member States as a result of the leakage of radioactivity into the sea
I give the floor to Mrs Bjerregaard to answer Mr Smith question
Mr President the Commission was not aware that in December the Nuclear Installations Inspectorate published a report on solid radioactive waste at Dounreay and Sellafield
The Commission has asked the UK authorities to give us this report
It is not clear whether the report to which Mr Smith is referring only concerns the safety of the plants or whether it also deals with the impact on the environment in the event of radioactive discharges into the sea
If the latter is the case our study of the report will focus on compliance with the basic safety standards for the protection of the population against ionised radiation and if necessary will take the form of an inspection pursuant to Article of the Euratom Treaty
The Commission plans to carry out further inspections under Article of the Euratom Treaty in March at Dounreay and probably in the year at Sellafield
I notice that Mr Fitzsimons is actually in the Chamber
Perhaps the Commissioner will reply to his question as well
I must confess I am totally surprised that the Commission was not aware of this report given its sensitivity at this particular time
It may indeed talk about the things that the Commissioner talks about or it may indeed talk about something completely different
But the important thing is I would have assumed that the Commission given its obligations under Article would have been aware of this particular matter
Quite honestly I am getting a bit tired of the Commission coming along here and telling us various things
When we approach the Council on these matters the Council always says this is a matter for the Commission the Commission responsibility
We come here to ask a question of the Commission and the Commission says We were not aware of this
So I do not have a supplementary question I just want to register my protest
Mr President I am very surprised by the comments from Mr Smith because in the light of his question I am naturally obliged to tell the House that we were unaware of the report and that as soon as we were made aware of it we asked the UK authorities to give it to us
We assume of course that we will receive it and then we shall deal with it in accordance with Article of the Euratom Treaty
Since we had not heard of this report it would have been very difficult for me to respond other than in the way I have done here today
I would like to ask Mrs Bjerregaard whether there is such poor communication between the environment ministers and the Commission that the Commission is also unaware as Mrs Ahern points out in her question that in December the Scandinavian environment ministers complained to the UK Government about the radioactive pollution which also affects Scandinavian waters whether against that background it is not a very long time to wait until the year to start inspections and whether it would not be more relevant to immediately send the inspection team to Dounreay as Mrs Ahern is asking the Commission to do
Mr President I would like to give the reply which was prepared for Mrs Ahern who is not present here today to Mrs Sandbæk instead because that is what the question was about as I understood it
The Commission is also unaware that the Scandinavian environment ministers have submitted complaints about marine pollution due to radioactive discharges from the processing plants at Sellafield and Dounreay
This is not in fact a great surprise to us because it concerns matters which are subject to the bilateral or multilateral contacts between these countries and the UK and Mrs Sandbæk also said that they had complained to the UK
However the Commission is of course aware that high concentrations of technetium have been found along the coastlines of the Scandinavian countries and in the Arctic Sea
The Commission took an active part in the Council of Ministers meeting held in Sintra in July 
At that meeting at which I was also present the question of radioactive discharges was raised and a reduction in principle of the volume of waste was adopted with a view to reaching a concentration close to zero and now we are looking a long way ahead by the year 
The UK Government has given assurances that it is acutely aware of the problem with technetium not least in connection with the handling of Sellafield discharge licences
Against that background I think I can say that we are of course monitoring developments very actively and that we also have the necessary contacts but that we must of course have it incorporated into our work schedule and take into account the number of people available if we are to carry out inspections
Thank you Mrs Bjerregaard
I should remind the House that we are dealing with Question No by Mr Smith to which that was a supplementary question
Mr Fitzsimons now has the floor to put a further supplementary
My question is related to Mr Smith question
I thank you for your replies thus far Commissioner but for years the Commission has been side-stepping the whole Sellafield issue which Mr Smith myself and many others have been raising
It has always failed to deal with the real issue namely the closing-down of Sellafield
Recently the German Government has been doing U-turns and going through all sorts of contortions in relation to the whole nuclear issue
Since there is no real future for the reprocessing of nuclear waste Commissioner do you not agree that it is time and that there is justification for the closing-down of Sellafield
Mr President it is of course a pleasure to see Mr Fitzsimons so that we can also deal with this part of the question
Now we may of course have many different opinions about nuclear power and for that matter about Sellafield and other things
I can well understand that Mr Fitzsimons and others think that some of my replies have been inadequate but I am obliged to confine myself to our areas of competence
And the Commission has no competence when it comes to inspecting the safety of nuclear plants
This supervision is the responsibility of the competent authorities of the Member States
It is also the operator and the Member State concerned who have to assess the economic viability of the facilities
Therefore every time we have had questions on these lines we have had to examine where we have competence and where we do not
And if you want more to be done as I understand that Mr Fitzsimons and others do I am afraid I have to disappoint you because I cannot exceed the competence we have been given in this area
Mr President I would like to ask a supplementary question I indicated at the beginning of Question Time that I wanted to do so
I have sat here patiently and I find it quite extraordinary that you are not calling me
Dounreay is in my constituency
Mrs Ewing it is not that I wish to deny you a supplementary question but the Rules only allow for two supplementaries and those have already been called
As President I have to abide by the Rules
The two supplementaries to Mr Smith question have been dealt with
I must now move on to Question No 
Do you have something to add Mrs Ewing
Mr President Mr Fitzsimons had his own question
It is very common when someone is a minute or so late to allow their question to be taken
That is what Mr Smith suggested
Instead of that you called Mr Fitzsimons as a supplementary to Mr Smith My request which was registered in good time is being ignored
As the longest serving member in this House I would say to you that there is no point in coming to Question Time if this is how you are going to treat the Member who represents the area in question
I am quite disgusted
I hope I have made it clear how sorry I am Mrs Ewing
In any event however Mr Fitzsimons was not given the floor to put his own question but for a supplementary one because he arrived late
Question No by Antonios Trakatellis H
Subject Maliakos Bay link breach of Community environment law As part of the Pathe road network tenders are being invited for the Maliakos Bay link an underground tunnel km long and metres wide to be dug at metres below the sea bed
Local authorities and organisations in the area are categorically opposed to the proposed project and studies have shown that Maliakos Bay is an unsuitable site for construction of this type a small shallow closed bay geological fault earthquake-prone fish farm
Is the Commission aware that the location of the project and the invitation to tender are in breach of Directives EEC and EC in that no complete and specific environmental impact assessment has been carried out no information has been made available to the public and there has been no attempt to find alternative solutions
Bearing in mind that Maliakos Bay and the wetland of the River Sperkhios have been proposed as protected areas under the Natura programme is it possible for this project to go ahead when it endangers the ecosystem and threatens to wipe out all forms of marine life in the region
Can the project be jointly financed from Community funds when it is in breach of Community legal provisions and what measures does the Commission intend to take to enforce those provisions
I give the floor to Mrs Bjerregaard to answer Mr Trakatellis question
Mr President the project concerned is part of the new motorway between Athens and Salonika
Large parts of the rest of the motorway are being cofinanced with the Commission
The section referred to by the honourable Member is not included in this financing
On the contrary it is to be built financed and operated by private investors
However I would like to stress that EU legislation must of course still be observed
Only the provisional studies in relation to the tunnel including therefore the environmental studies are being cofinanced through the operational programme for road networks within the framework of EU aid to Greece for
I have the impression that the honourable Member believes the public invitation to tender in connection with the tunnel has already started
That is not the information which I have
According to the information which the Commission has that is not the case and the only thing the Greek authorities have done is to announce that the project will be carried out and thus invite individual businesses to register their declarations of interest
Before a public invitation to tender is issued there will be an environmental impact assessment in accordance with the provisions of Directive 
The Sperheios River valley and the Maliakos Kolpos estuary are indeed among the sites which the Greek authorities have proposed for inclusion in the Natura network in accordance with the habitats directive
The Sperheios estuary has been designated as a specially protected area under the birds directive
According to Article of the habitats directive a project which is damaging to the ecological integrity of a Natura area and for which there are no alternative solutions can only be given consent for imperative reasons of overriding public interest and if appropriate compensatory measures are adopted
These rules already apply to the specially protected areas including the Sperheios estuary but not to the site as a whole
This will happen automatically if the site is included in the Natura network
Consequently in accordance with Directive and the Treaty on European Union the Greek authorities must refrain from any activity which could significantly damage the ecological integrity of this site
The Commission services will make enquiries of the Greek authorities to ensure that they have complied with their obligations under the current legislation and with regard to the project in question
According to the Greek authorities the project will not affect the Sperheios area but that is one of the things of which the Commission wishes to be sure
Mr President I would first of all like to thank the Commissioner for her answer and I would also like to remind her and I am sure that she is mindful of the fact that all the prefectures and communities in this region have already registered their protests
Thirty-two authorities from throughout the region which have protested and which have not been asked about the project have appealed under Greek law to the State Council
In accordance with the Community directive these official bodies should be allowed to participate in the project
As a result there has been a great deal of turmoil in the region and nobody wants this project
However there are alternative solutions
This bridging project could be carried out differently not via the Gulf of Maliakos
It is curious to note that while the Ministry for the Environment places this region within Natura with the onset of the work it will destroy this region by carrying out a bridging operation which will totally transform this deep gulf into one which is incapable of supporting any form of marine life whatsoever
I would ask the Commissioner therefore to monitor this affair very closely as it is of great significance for all communities and inhabitants in the region
Yes I am aware that this is a matter which has aroused a great deal of interest in Greece and also that there have been protests in connection with the project
That is also why I can assure Mr Trakatellis that we will ask the Greek authorities about this matter
There are rules which apply in this case both in connection with the habitats directive and Natura and we shall of course study carefully the replies we receive because it is our task to ensure that the environment is treated properly which is also what we shall do in this case
It is now pm and as Commissioner Bjerregaard was given minutes for questions starting at pm by my calculations there is still some time remaining
Could I draw your attention to the Rules in particular to the annex to Rule conduct of Question Time and could I respectfully suggest that as well as showing a red light to Members you show a red light and a red card to Commissioners at times because this is what is taking up the time
The last answer that Commissioner Bjerregaard gave took minutes seconds
Members are cut off at minute while some of the answers from Commissioner van den Broek were very long-winded
It might be salutary for the Commissioners to instruct their staff to give briefer and more pungent answers to Members questions which in turn would allow more Members to get a chance to raise the concerns of their constituents
I was about to raise a very serious incident relating to a power failure at a nuclear power station which had it taken place could have had catastrophic implications
I would like to draw this to your attention
I am always grateful for comments and suggestions from the floor because I believe I need to take everyone views into account to be an effective President
Do bear in mind however Mr McMahon that this afternoon sitting began at exactly pm
Question Time to the Commission should therefore have finished at pm
We ought to be concerned not only for the Members but also for the services working in the House
At present for instance we are running minutes over the finishing time for our services including the interpreters
As you are aware the work of the latter is particularly demanding
As President I do my best to deal fairly with the many supplementary questions which arise but I cannot work miracles
Hence we have run minutes over the time allocated for today and Mrs Bjerregaard has used the time to which she was entitled
I must now close Question Time and thank Mrs Bjerregaard for her replies for being here today and indeed for her patience
Questions Nos to will receive written answers
That concludes questions to the Commission
The sitting was suspended at pm and resumed at pm
Common organisation of the market in wine continuation
The next item is the continuation of the debate on the report A by Mr P Martin on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development on the proposal for a Council Regulation on the common organisation of the market in wine CCNS
Mr President I think we need to begin by acknowledging the significant amendments the European Commission is making to the proposal
The image of a wine sector that produces huge surpluses was all that remained of that proposal a proposal we have fortunately moved on from today and which was geared exclusively to the wholesale grubbing-up of vineyards
The current reform however which is today clearly also the subject of discussion and controversy focuses on improving the present balance between supply and demand and above all giving producers the opportunity to adapt to and take advantage of expanding markets
But we should not be overly optimistic
In my opinion the proposals put forward by the European Commission in relation to one of the issues being debated new planting rights seem more fitting than the Committee on Agriculture opinion
I also think that the Commission proposals are better able to provide this guarantee of dynamic equilibrium
What is more it seems more positive to grant % of the replanting rights in relation to the designated wine-growing areas in zones where demand is increasing than to extend the limit to 
Complementary measures in this regard might include permanent grubbing-up measures for regions with structural surpluses and a revised regulation for replanting rights which might extend beyond the wine years after the year in which grubbing-up took place
The chapter on reconversion which also focuses on aligning production to market demands has been concluded positively both in terms of recovering restructuring costs and including the possibility of financing specific measures to support wine making in regions which because of drought have difficult cultivation conditions
However we completely disagree with the fact that Member States may continue to contribute up to % of the cost for production regions located outside of Objective 
As regards market mechanisms we fully endorse the increase in the volume of alcohol in wine-making installations to % from % through the vinification of grape musts
Similarly we think that an important step has been taken as regards the use of specific distillation methods in potable alcohol which means that supplies to the Community sector will be guaranteed a sector that annually demands almost million hectolitres
Lastly in the event of a market disturbance we should like to see the continued application of crisis legislation on a voluntary basis in line with the Commission proposal in Article 
In our opinion it is vital that specific aid and measures for promoting wine consumption and providing consumers with information be included in a new title in the new regulation
From the point of view of who has overall responsibility for these matters the number of important decisions to be taken by the management committee as laid down in Article and subsequent articles seems excessive This is why we endorse measures aimed at restoring balance to the decision-making procedures
Finally we must once again stress our opposition to the oenological practices used to increase levels of alcohol strength through the addition of saccharose This immediately calls into question the definition of wine in Annex where it is defined as the product obtained exclusively from the total or partial alcoholic fermentation of fresh grapes or of fresh grape must
Mr President Commissioner ladies and gentlemen with regard to Mr Martin report we should welcome not only the important and high-quality work produced by the rapporteur but also the fact that the time devoted to preparing discussing and organising this work enabled the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development to provide Parliament with a good report which is comprehensive and coherent and which was adopted by a large majority
We should be aware that such a result was only possible due to the close dialogue held with wine growers and also because the basic ideas behind the report were inspired by the general report on the reform of the CAP which had already been adopted by Parliament
This also means that in several areas the report does not follow the liberal proposals made by the Commission
The report therefore maintains a definition of the quality of wine an agricultural and viticultural product and in this way rejects all forms of industrialisation
It affirms Europe intention to increase its share of world production of quality wine which is linked to human health when consumed in moderation
In order to achieve this the report proposes controlling the expansion of vineyards notably for the benefit of young farmers and a more efficient measure for replanting and improvements to vineyard management techniques
Finally all of this must be guaranteed by regulated management which includes promotion and adjustment instruments such as compulsory distillation and which must not be left to the responsibility of the Commission
I strongly support the priority given within such a framework to enrichment by grape musts rather than by sugaring the ban on the import of musts from third countries which would be a Trojan horse for the quality of European production the ban on blending white wine and red wine and finally the clear definition of the specific characteristics of each wine product natural sweet wines for example are the only product capable of maintaining a level of human economic activity in certain areas of production of the Union
Everyone can see that the draft CAP reforms tend to become embedded in the rut defined by the Commission too liberal tendencies
The Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development is very attentive to the demands of the experts and of society
This is why we will be approving the report which has been presented to us
Mr President today the round of debates on the reform of the CAP within the framework of Agenda comes to an end
These debates have revealed how difficult it is to find a common denominator which will reconcile national interests which are divided by profound and increasingly visible differences
I hope that the debate on wine-growing will benefit the wine producer the product and the consumer alike
Our rapporteur Mr Martin has contributed substantially towards this
If nothing else wine has brought people together from time immemorial and has been an important element in social cultural and religious life
As far as an appreciation of the Commission proposal is concerned it represents in principle a step forwards in tackling the problems faced by the sector
The complex regulatory framework which has thus far taken shape is an obstacle to attaining market equilibrium developing productive capacity improving the quality of wine and promoting products on the European and global market
The current policy of grubbing up vines has resulted in a % reduction in the area given over to vines in the EU which is being inundated with wine from third countries thanks to their aggressive production and marketing policy
In Greece in particular there has been a % reduction which is threatening the quality of Greek vineyards as the abovementioned policy has primarily affected vineyards of local varieties of high quality but with a limited production capacity
For this reason at least % must be se aside for new planting rights in order to enable European vineyards to make the necessary quality adjustments especially in the regions which have been damaged most by the grubbing-up policy
As regards trade with third countries we cannot accept a proposal which allows grape must to be imported from third countries for use in wine production
With regard to wine-making practices and the possibility of increasing the alcoholic content of wine with sugar we must maintain the status quo the historical continuity of a product which is pre-eminently traditional
I would like to end with a word about the problems faced by island vineyards and vineyards in mountainous regions especially in Greece where production is dispersed over small-scale vineyards in just such regions
The special soil and climatic conditions favour the production of high-quality products which the consumer wants but production costs are high and constitute an inhibitory factor
The new COM must provide a special support structure for these crops
Mr President Commissioner ladies and gentlemen I should also like to congratulate Mr Martin not only on his excellent report but also on his tireless efforts in the search for agreements and compromises
I should also like to congratulate the Commission because on this occasion it has put forward a proposal which differs radically from the famous proposal it unfortunately put forward in 
This time the proposal is better adapted to the current needs and concerns of the sector and therefore constitutes a valid starting point to allow Parliament and the Council to reach important agreements
I should like to concentrate here on three of the fundamental issues approved by Parliament
First safeguard clauses have been included in the recitals articles and provisions on repeal which in spite of the repeal of more than Council regulations are aimed at guaranteeing future respect for the acquis communautaire in the area of quality wines produced in specific regions
Second with regard to the distillation of table wines to obtain alcohol for potable uses I should like to thank the rapporteur for having accepted our amendments and for having included them in the final version
This has meant that the aid set for table wines to be distilled for potable uses will definitely not be set at the Commission discretion Instead the Commission will have to set the aid in proportion to the needs to supply potable alcohol to those sectors which according to the rules are obliged to use it
Brandy and liqueur wine production will be safeguarded as a consequence and the production of more than hectares of vines and thousands of jobs in vineyards wine-cellars related industries andancillary services will be maintained
It is crucial for this aid to be set at a level which guarantees the competitiveness of by-products of wine for potable uses If both the by-products of wine and the aid given for these products were to disappear the cost of the by-products used to make brandy would increase by % whereas alcoholic products made from molasses and cereals would remain stable
This would increase the current price differences in alcoholic wine products and force drinks that have to use the by-products of wine off the market
Moreover Parliament has improved the Commission proposal by setting out the ways in which the aid given will be annually reviewed and precisely how primary and secondary aid will be monitored
And as in previous amendments that I tabled in the House I believe that this will guarantee the prices of potable alcohol as well as an annual minimum distillation volume of million hectolitres
Lastly I welcome the Committee on Agriculture decision to accept separate technical definitions for fortified wine and fortified liqueur wine in Annex 
The particular production methods and organoleptic characteristics of these types of wine mean that they are differentiated and distinct and as such merit a separate definition
The proposal for a reform offers a welcome opportunity to set out an independent and distinct definition of these fortified wines which were not and are not the same as the liqueur wines mentioned in the original COM in wine
And in terms of geographical appellation surface area of the vineyard wine producing and wine making trade and job creation they mean far more than other products that are defined separately in the basic regulation of the original COM
Mr President this proposal encourages and promotes free imports of wines and musts from third countries destined to be mixed with Community wines
The Council and Commission forget that there are Community wines of a very special quality which can enrich the quality of Community wines in a most wonderful and natural way It is not necessary to import such wines from third countries
They also forget the relentless way in which the vineyards have been targeted over many years
Tens of thousands of hectares of vines have been grubbed up at a rate which has been very detrimental to Greece
This tragic situation is very difficult to reconcile with the approach you are taking today unless of course there are ulterior motives and dubious interests at work
You are promoting a moratorium on planting and you want to restrict wine growing push it to the brink and perhaps even create a shortfall to justify opening the floodgates to imports to serve the interests of the WTO and GATT thereby obtaining compensation in other sectors which interest you
You are allowing sugar to be added to Community wines especially to German wines in order to increase the alcohol content
This is inconsistent with the restriction on production and the quality that you are after
If you wish to favour Germany then at least have the sugar content written on the product
Finally Mr President this proposal upgrades the institution of the inter-branch organisations and aims to force the poor wine grower to compete on the same terms as the ruthless industrial processors of this precious commodity
You are sacrificing this product Commissioner and you are sacrificing it to illicit questionable interests
You forget that it is not simply a product it is a popular form of sustenance and it provides excellent employment
Wine is civilisation it is tradition and culture
Do not forget that
There are countries in which since the time of Homer people have been brought up with this culture of wine
And you are sacrificing it on the altar of questionable multinational interests
Mr President I too believe that Mr Martin has done a good job overall particularly bearing in mind the outcome secured in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development as compared with the others
Nonetheless I am not one of those satisfied with the end result and I therefore did not vote in favour in the Committee on Agriculture
I think more can be done and will therefore discuss two aspects in particular that I believe to be gaps about which I am dissatisfied
My first point concerns the reinclusion of compulsory distillation which had actually been removed from the Commission proposal
This proposal is contradictory we cannot demand on the basis of the market equilibrium that has now been achieved to be allowed to launch a policy of replanting and renewing vines while once again proposing compulsory distillation
I think this is a contradiction that has to be resolved by the vote in plenary and our action as I suggested earlier in the price package must be based primarily on a policy of replanting or intelligent grubbing-up managed on a regional basis within the European Union
Many Members in this House have spoken about quality and the need to protect the agricultural origin of the wine and the product itself however no effort has been made to work towards harmonisation not even of production and vinification methods
I recognise that it is difficult to ban the addition of sucrose but all the same something could be done to improve quality measures could be taken regarding the level of minimum must content or labelling or we could leave things as they are but find a way of rewarding those countries with the best record on this
But nothing significant has been done here
And that is why without wishing to start a revolution we shall again be raising the issue of quality rather more seriously and consistently
Finally it is worth pointing out that we are discussing a sector that has been penalised in terms of resources it is accorded half of what it contributes to European agriculture GDP
More must be done to promote the product on the international markets
Mr President ladies and gentlemen Philippe-Armand Martin report modifies some aspects of the Commission proposal
These changes are mostly positive ones and take account of the amendments that we tabled and adopted in the Agriculture Committee
They include the possibility of renewing vineyards and aid for promoting consumption in the internal and external markets and banning products made from musts originating in third countries or prohibiting imports of such musts for vinification
Lastly I would like to refer to our acceptance of crisis distillation and the introduction of certain aids albeit insufficient for producer organisations and vines planted in less-favoured areas
However we cannot go on allowing wine a Mediterranean product accounting for around % of the Community agricultural production to be funded by only % of the agriculture budget whilst arable crops which chiefly concern the countries of central and northern parts of the EU receive % of that budget although they account for less than % of Community agricultural production
This is just one more example of the clear discrimination that will still exist between different crops after this reform
We also think it is unacceptable for products resulting from processes such as sugaring to raise alcohol content to be called wine
We are therefore tabling certain amendments which we hope will be approved making it compulsory to include this on the labels of such products to inform and protect consumers and also to set a five-year deadline for ending once and for all the practice of adding sugar to wine
Mr President Commissioner for at least seven or eight years now we have been discussing wine and the now notorious reform of the wine sector
As you will be aware Commissioner back in for instance proposals were tabled on which I had the honour to act as rapporteur in the House in 
So this particular wine has been tasted at some length
That shows both how complex and controversial reform of the sector is but it also demonstrates that clouds do sometimes have a silver lining
And that is fortunate because the failure to implement the old concept of reform has been a blessing for European wine-producers
That reform was finally shelved and what we have on the table today as previous speakers have rightly pointed out are other ideas which are certainly an improvement on the past
The fact is that the fundamental approach taken previously was flawed
I recall that your predecessor Commissioner Steichen predicted that come the year there would be a million hectolitre wine surplus that was used to justify adopting drastic and extremely punishing measures inspired by the pessimism of the bureaucrats which would have been highly damaging to Europe wine growers
In point of fact there have been no surpluses for some years now and that change of fortune is I believe not the work of Bacchus but a result of the extensive grubbing-up and the ban on replanting during that period which substantially impoverished European vineyards and left us with ageing vine stocks
Europe has therefore lost ground in an art in which it has been and remains the world leader
Of course that has caused some alarm bells to ring
Competition from new European producers is beginning to have a significant impact within Europe too
In the space of a few years imports of wine from outside Europe have doubled
There are countries where costs are far lower than they are here countries that enjoy far greater freedom of movement and which are not restricted by the bureaucratic obstacles and red tape that have always plagued European wine growers
And so this new and sensible approach is welcome I acknowledge that Commissioner Fischler
With this new proposal the Commission is I think taking a fresh approach based on the premiss that we now need to help a sector which has in recent years achieved market equilibrium and must therefore avoid adopting measures that could destroy it
In my view the best remedy is a good dose of liberalisation
I realise that coming from a Socialist that may sound surprising but the wine sector in particular shows that excessive regulation can also be fatal
And so we need to take a more dynamic approach to Europe vineyards there has to be advance replanting extensive restructuring of vineyards and higher allocations than currently provided for in the Commission proposal
Indeed I share the view expressed by previous speakers that more must be done to restore balance
We have an agricultural policy under which products continue to be protected by applying two different sets of criteria a policy under which there is a huge gulf between the support given to products from central and northern Europe and the support given to Mediterranean products
I think that the rapporteur has done a good job but not good enough the report is sound on a number of controversial issues such as the import of musts the powers of the Commission and the efforts made to make Europe vineyards more dynamic
On two points however which have already been mentioned by Mr Filippi we are unable to agree with Commissioner Fischler principally the questions of compulsory distillation and the addition of sucrose
I do not agree with the point concerning compulsory distillation because the Commission has proposed optional crisis distillation which I consider to be the right response to the new market dynamic
As far as the addition of sucrose is concerned I am well aware of the fact that anyone tackling this problem runs enormous risks in particular the risk of blocking all the rest of the reform
Nonetheless it would have been worth taking account of the existing differences and inequities and sending out the message which we are always calling for that European producers must enjoy equal worth and show solidarity
We are always talking about quality well I believe that quality also means giving priority to products wholly derived from the vine
Mr President Commissioner I hope it has been worth the wait
After the abortive proposal to reform the Common Organisation of the Market in Wine in and following our proposed amendments in the Commission has certainly taken its time in submitting a new proposal for reform
However it has now adopted a more positive approach and it is indeed inconceivable that we should think of meddling with Europe wine-growing potential with all its tradition and its wonderful variety and simply abandon the European internal market and the world market to competition from third countries whatever the World Trade Organisation may say
The human race would be healthier if far more people could afford to drink one two or even three glasses of wine every day
The way to meet such a level of demand is not compulsory distillation or grubbing-up but a far higher production levelof quality wines especially in the Community and of course far lower excise duties than those currently levied in many Member States particularly in the north of the EU
Having said that I am delighted that thanks to the enormous amount of work put in by our rapporteur Mr Martin whom I would like to thank very sincerely the Agriculture Committee has managed to make some real improvements to the Commission proposal This has involved some sensible compromises and to achieve these compromises we have all had to mix a little water with our wine
I am sorry that despite all these efforts some of our colleagues from the south have again gone on the war-path against the centuries-old wine-growing practices in the north of the Community
And the strange idea some people have that wine growers not using enrichment should be given additional planting rights is simply crazy
I personally can agree to the compromise which took so much hard work to achieve
I can live with it especially because overall it represents a positive approach to maintaining and increasing marketable wine production which after all makes a magnificent contribution to preserving our wonderful landscape not least in my own country
But the Agriculture Committee proposals are also well-balanced and sensible when it comes to wine-growing practices new planting rights and flexible measures in the event of poor weather conditions or unusually abundant grape harvests where maximum yields are involved
I would ask the Commission and Mr Fischler in particular to adopt our proposals for the additional chapter on special aid and support measures for wine products and for the involvement of trade organisations in this
I would be pleased if he could confirm this today
The proposals also include initiatives to promote moderate wine consumption and advertising campaigns outside the Community
That is the right way to go
I hope that the Commission and the Council of Ministers will support us in this and that a substantial majority of this House will vote for it as a large majority for this sensible compromise is our best chance of making our voice heard in the Council of Ministers
Mr President I wish to point out that firstly vineyards are just recovering from the shock of large-scale grubbing-up Secondly they are suffering massive discrimination
Statistics given by the Commissioner show that in a dairy company received an average of ECU million from the EAGGF a combined meat and dairy company received ECU arable farmers received ECU while a wine-producing company received on average ECU 
The figures speak for themselves
We are concerned about what is happening and I wish to highlight the following important points
Firstly sugar is used for making cakes and pastries not wine
Existing regulations and their planned extension will in my opinion undermine the essence of the European Union wine-producing proposal and position
Secondly do we not want to improve the quality of our wines
We have must within the Community which is of excellent quality and we do not need to turn to imports from third countries
Thirdly to alleviate the shock caused by grubbing-up there must be an increase in planting which can start with the % which is being debated
Fourthly we believe that distillation is not something we can impose willy-nilly on the producers
They produce wine
If they want to carry out distillation this should be left up to them as it is now and we should not legislate to make distillation compulsory
Finally Mr President I think that special measures are needed for vineyards in mountainous and island regions
Mr President I am sorry to see that the idea of insisting on bottling at source has crept into Mr Martin otherwise excellent report
Insisting on bottling at source is a well-meaning and naive attempt to protect jobs and the reputation of the wines from particular wine-growing regions
Unfortunately with respect it shows an enormous ignorance of what actually happens to wine in those countries that it is shipped to
Nor does it recognise the changing way in which wine is distributed marketed or consumed especially in northern Europe
On arrival the wines are specially packed to meet the needs of the particular markets
They are canned or boxed with the supermarkets own labels or they are placed in specialist chilled containers for the restaurant and pub market for easy sale by the glass
I am assured that bulk imports in the UK are carefully protected by making sure that the right label goes on the right wine
They do not put the word Bordeaux on a bottle of wine or a can of wine that has come from a third country
They make certain that their computerised systems respect quality The bottlers have an interest in ensuring that they are seen to be selling quality wines
It may be that we need to ensure that these control systems are transparent and obvious to all
Perhaps this is something we can discuss in detail during the passage of Mrs Lulling report at some point in the future
But please do not let us risk job losses in our own wine areas and possibly creating problems for our own bottlers by creating barriers between producers distributors and consumers which are artificial and will damage trade within the Union
Mr President Commissioner ladies and gentlemen the importance of the wine sector in the rural economy of the European Union is recognised by all
However it must be pointed out that this is due to Europe dominant international position Europe share of the production in this sector is % and moreover % of this is exported
So you may ask why have a market organisation
Well quite simply because the economy is increasingly becoming a global one and we have to adopt Community rules in order to organise ourselves properly in view of this globalisation
That is why I consider it useful to emphasise certain aspects of the report which are of major importance to wine growing in Europe
As regards the planting of vines we have made great efforts over the past ten years to reduce the areas under vines
From now on if we need to know how to grub up vines in certain fragile zones we should also know how to replant them taking into account the requirements and demand for quality
This is why we must show flexibility and allow expanding regions to meet demand by replanting vines while reducing surpluses in certain areas
As for oenological practices I am very concerned by what I have just heard
As a Frenchman in the heart of Europe I would say this to you let us put an end to this war waged by the Gauls in southern Europe against those in northern Europe and let us respect the traditions inherited from our ancestors which are accepted and effective
We are fighting amongst ourselves and our attitudes are equally rigid
As regards the wine industry it is clear that it is the close cooperation between production and trade that has established satisfactory trade patterns for both the consumer and the quality of the wine appreciated by him
This is why we need to respect the organisations set up in our regions and above all the crucial role they play in adapting resources to requirements
As far as exports are concerned let us know how to open up our markets to the outside world and provide the means to promote communications on product quality in Europe
Finally it is in this spirit and on the basis of a Commission proposal which seemed to us overcautious and at times Malthusian and too bureaucratic that the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development has examined the report on the COM in wine
Numerous meetings and discussions have enabled us to arrive at the compromise reflected in the text which has been presented to you
Ladies and gentlemen from both North and South we must vote in favour of this report
It represents significant progress in comparison with the proposal and it should ensure that our opinion is taken into account by the Council
At any rate I sincerely hope this is the case
Mr President Commissioner ladies and gentlemen it is the diversity its variety the special characteristics the taste and last but not least the way it is identified with specific regions that ultimately sets European wine apart
We now find ourselves faced with the difficult task of trying to regulate this diversity within a Common Market Organisation and to regulate it in such a way that this diversity is preserved
We do not want a uniform European wine but we do want a legal framework that is workable
I come from one of Europe northern wine-growing areas from the Mosel region
Our wines grow in different climatic conditions which makes them different but they have their connoisseurs and there is certainly a market for them
I would like to thank the Commission and our rapporteur Mr Martin and also the Agriculture Committee for making it possible to reach a compromise on this common organisation for wine which in recognition of the specific characteristics of individual regions provides for traditional wine-growing practices to be maintained
This means the wine from Europe regions that we know and appreciate will be preserved
Jobs in upstream and downstream sectors will also be preserved as will our agricultural landscapes
You can regulate the market but you cannot regulate nature the weather and the harvest
I am therefore in favour of setting a quantity of wine that can be marketed in any given year
Our wine-growing regions have already set corresponding maximum yields per hectare
But I am vehemently opposed to the Commission proposal that if the yield per hectare is exceeded by % the entire harvest would lose the right to be designated as quality wine
Up to now quality wine has not been regulated in this way
Every farmer and every wine grower is dependent on the weather and good years are needed to compensate for bad ones
Wine from years when there was a good harvest can be marketed during years with poorer yields as a way of ensuring the income of family businesses
So we should allow carry-over
I would particularly ask you to consider this point again
Mr President Commissioner ladies and gentlemen I should firstly like to congratulate the rapporteur on his report and on the level of consensus reached in the House which is something that has not been easy
This issue is still pending from the CAP reform and the Commission proposal is of vital importance for the present and above all the future of this sector especially given the crossroads European wine making has reached
We need the instruments to enable us to be competitive in today open market and to enable the European Union to maintain its position as world leader in this sector a sector which has an enormous added value in both social and economic terms
The consensus reached clearly respects the specific traditional qualities and the various oenological practices that exist and also lays great emphasis on quality and promotion both inside and outside the European Union What is more it enables European wine making to enjoy moderate and controlled growth
As regards alcohol and other related issues I shall try not to repeat everything that has already been said but I should like to stress the need to strike a balance between the technical progress made and the need to preserve the specific characteristics of European wine
This is something else that the reform must resolve
As a result demand for European wine in an increasingly open market would increase if it were more competitive and if such competitiveness was not solely confined to vineyards but also extended to include improved installations as was mentioned and wine promotion that is linked to the dissemination of the results of scientific research on wine
We are also in favour of the creation of a standing committee for wine exports as we believe this is vital
Commissioner there is however one other issue which concerns me namely wine making which purports to be European but which uses grape musts that have been imported from third countries
Can you comment on this
In my view Commissioner you have a golden opportunity to adopt the amendments approved by the House and in particular the consensus reached here which we have worked hard to achieve
Indeed we must admit that some have worked harder than others Nonetheless I believe that this would be in the interests of European wine making for you to adopt these amendments
Mr President Commissioner as far as I can see I am the last speaker
Well we have drained this particular bottle and as often happens we are left with the lees that could have clouded the wine
Thank goodness I am as I said the last speaker yes indeed because I think that the Commission proposal is a sound one I think the rapporteur has shown admirable zeal taking the diplomatic rather than the technical approach and yet for me the reform and the outcome of this work are something of a hollow victory
In politics there is a tendency to evaluate any given issue depending on whether you come to it from the Left or the Right
When we discuss agriculture we inevitably return Mrs Lulling to the old way of looking at a problem as perceived from the North or the South
Despite the best of intentions that gap has yet to be bridged in fact the gulf is still very wide
This could have been an opportunity for trying to reach across it but for reasons that other Italian colleagues have already explained we cannot be optimistic about the chances of what I would venture a little exaggeratedly perhaps to describe as an almost epoch-making recovery from an age-old handicap and it will be a few years yet before there is any possibility of even a partial recovery
However I do not wish to cloud the issue of the wine at all
There are some positive aspects and I would like to mention one or two of them
First we have the move towards quality and the promotion of wine as a drink that is completely harmless and digestible suitable for all ages and all tables then there is the aid for vineyard restructuring replacing table wines with quality wines in addition we have aid for young producers and for disadvantaged mountain regions
Those elements with which I cannot agree are however the dearth of protection against wine from third countries and the excessive focus on the technical aspects of cultivation and bottling with less attention paid to the aspects of production
Unsatisfactory also is the drive towards replacing saccharose with concentrated and rectified must with all the necessary incentives for reasons already explained by other colleagues
Finally I come to compulsory distillation I have to wag my finger at my old friend Mr Martin here
It was an excellent idea on the part of the Commissioner and the Commission to get rid of compulsory distillation and keep only crisis distillation
For reasons that I have yet to understand our friend Mr Martin has sought to reinstate it
It is up to you to redress the balance Commissioner
Mr President ladies and gentlemen I would firstly like to thank you all for the work you have put into examining the Commission proposal on the market in wine
And I would especially like to thank Mr Martin as rapporteur for his analysis of the proposal and above all and this has already been acknowledged by several speakers for his efforts to achieve a compromise
By virtue of all these efforts we have been able to ensure that the proposal for the wine sector will not slip behind the other Agenda reform proposals
As you know this proposal is intended to replace existing Council regulations to achieve simplification and to cover all basic areas from the vine to the labelled product
Although the final list of amendments is rather long I am still pleased to see that there are many important subjects on which we are at one
In particular we are in agreement that quality is essential to maintain and improve the competitiveness of Community wine and that the conversion measures planned should play an important part in achieving this objective
We are also agreed that the market position requires more flexible administration of production potential
There is also agreement that we must preserve the specific character of all Community wines and provide a legal basis for this by means of regulations on traditional winemaking methods
Before I respond to your amendments in more detail allow me to remind you once again of the seven objectives of the Commission reform proposal
First we want to make the wine sector more competitive
Second we want to maintain the improved balance between supply and demand
Third we want to eliminate the availability of intervention as an artificial outlet for surplus production
Fourth we want to continue to maintain all traditional outlets for potable alcohol and other products
Fifth we want to accommodate regional diversity
Sixth we want to strengthen the role of producer organisations and inter-branch organisations
And seventh we want to considerably simplify the legislative framework and make it more transparent
There is a large degree of agreement on these objectives
Some of your amendments suggest improvements in the measures we have proposed in order to realise these objectives
In particular we consider the new wording of the provisions on the creation of a legal framework for producer organisations and inter-branch organisations to be a very constructive proposal
I hope that will answer Mrs Lulling question
We have already started to discuss this
Other helpful amendments are those on the introduction of criteria for triggering crisis distillation new rules for liqueur wines and a whole series of technical improvements
However there are also areas where we differ and I would like to discuss those in rather more detail today
In order to give areas where production cannot keep pace with demand an opportunity for some limited expansion the Commission is proposing an allocation of newly created planting rights totalling some hectares
Spread over a period of three years this is nearly twice as much as the additional rights granted under the last two agriculture price packages
Furthermore the proposal that producers undertaking to grub up areas under vines will simultaneously be granted replanting rights will also lead to a considerable expansion in production potential
This expansion could even be substantially greater than the hectares which we are to achieve with the additional percentage
So I cannot see any scope for us to go any further as we would otherwise jeopardise the objective of balancing supply and demand
In one amendment there is a call for the inclusion of pure and simple renewal of vineyards in the restructuring measures
I would like to remind you that the restructuring measures are intended to help to adjust production in certain problem areas to changes in market demand
Of course we only have limited means at our disposal and we cannot therefore afford to finance measures which up to now have always been part of normal vineyard management
Again on restructuring measures you have suggested that restructuring costs outside Objective areas should be cofinanced by up to % by Member States
I recognise that cofinancing is still under discussion but a final decision on that will have to be taken as part of the Agenda package
This therefore needs to be dealt with separately from the common organisation for wine as part of the overall financing of Agenda 
Certain other amendments raised doubts about the status quo as regards enrichment especially enrichment by sugaring
I have to agree with Mr Bébéar in this case I think it is years too late for us to start thinking about waging a new war between the southern and northern states
So I believe that we are right in sticking to the various traditional enrichment methods or oenological practices
As regards the amendments concerning the proposed crisis distillation measure I am firmly convinced that the Commission approach is the right one
Compulsory measures are inappropriate in the more open market which has prevailed since the Uruguay Round in which minimum prices can no longer be set as the withdrawal of quantities of wine would simply result in making room for additional imports
However I can accept your proposal to incorporate additional criteria for triggering the measure in the Council text particularly those on market prices
Another amendment calls for the common market organisation to include measures for internal and external sales promotion
I would like to be clear about this I think that external sales promotion would be more effective in a horizontal regulation
But I am of course in favour of external sales promotion measures
However I think that the various views of the Member States on the promotion of sales in the internal market and the overall stance of the Member States on the sale or promotion of sales of alcoholic drinks would make it difficult to include this in the common organisation of the market in wine
With regard to lifting the current ban on producing wine from must originating from third countries a subject several Members touched upon I am conscious how strongly some Member States feel about this provision
We have taken detailed advice from various experts and have received clear legal opinions indicating that our WTO obligations quite simply require us to lift the present general ban
The Commission has nevertheless explained to the Member States that our proposal will very probably include provisions on controls and labelling including a scheme for depositing an import security in order to guarantee that wine made from third country must cannot be regarded as Community wine
Lastly a number of amendments have been tabled about quality wines produced in specified regions
I would like to make it clear that we intend to adopt the provisions of the current Council regulations in their entirety
Nevertheless we want to limit the Council regulations to general provisions and to cover the remaining provisions in implementing regulations With regard to maximum yields of quality wine the Commission has already taken this opportunity to draw up a common scheme for cases where a maximum yield is exceeded so that uniform conditions are guaranteed for Community producers of quality wine
As long as Member States can settle this question efficiently themselves by means of transparent provisions at national level then we could revisit this proposal and thus take account of Mrs Klaß concerns
Lastly I would like to discuss an amendment affecting various parts of the proposal
This calls for various Council decisions affecting market organisation to be subject to Parliament opinion
Although I regard this as an excellent decision-making procedure for major changes and above all changes of policy it is simply too slow and cumbersome for purely technical market organisation measures where decisions are needed so that we can react promptly to the market situation
It is precisely for that reason that we have made a conscious decision to cover basic principles in a Council regulation whilst decisions on market organisation are to be made at Commission level
This is intended to maximise flexibility and ensure a rapid response
I cannot therefore accept any amendments that would jeopardise this objective
I hope that my comments have made the Commission position on the amendments included in the report sufficiently clear
In conclusion I would like to stress once again the large measure of agreement which is apparent on many important questions
Mr President I was thoroughly confused by Commissioner Fischler explanation about imports of must from third countries for vinification
I did not understand his explanation Does the Commissioner realise what an explosive decision it would be to allow this precedent
Mr President I really thought that my explanation on that point was very clear
I clearly stated that the present GATT rules do not allow us to keep a ban on imports of must
If we are to comply with GATT we have to change this
However what we very probably can do is to ensure that imported must even if it is mixed with musts produced in the Community is adequately labelled so that anyone can see that the wine in question has been produced from imported musts
So it is a question of ensuring that consumers can see that a wine containing imported must is indeed a wine that is either partly or entirely produced from imported must
But we cannot simply ban imports of must
Thank you Mr Fischler
The debate is closed
The vote will take place on Thursday at am
Crossing of EU external borders
Mr President Commissioners ladies and gentlemen thegovernments of the Member States have now accepted the fact that asylum policy can no longer be dealt with at national level only
The Amsterdam Treaty has confirmed this view by making it possible to eventually make asylum a Community policy with qualified majority voting in the Council
However time is short and such an uncertain time-limit for harmonising Member States practice is not feasible
Several attempts have been made under the third pillar and we must hope that these will be transposed promptly into Community law
The Dublin Convention has entered into force but several problems have been observed with its implementation
The Council resolution on minimum guarantees for asylum procedures comprises some positive developments but we regret that its provisions are not binding
The Council Joint Position of March on the harmonised implementation of the definition of the term refugee endorses a restrictive interpretation of the Geneva Convention which excludes persons persecuted by third parties from being granted refugee status and creates situations which are difficult to manage and tragic in human terms
The successive proposals for a joint action on temporary protection which seek to provide a response in the event of massive inflows of displaced persons have met with difficulties in the Council
There is an area where progress has not been made on harmonisation and that is forms of protection complementary to the Geneva Convention although it has been included as an item in the Council programme for several years
In fact the Geneva Convention does not cover all situations involving persons who have fled their country of origin and cannot or do not wish to return because they have justified fears of being persecuted
Even if the Geneva Convention were interpreted in accordance with the UNHCR recommendations which is what we are firmly calling for in this report a legal vacuum would still continue to exist between the level of protection guaranteed by the Geneva Convention and the temporary protection currently under discussion which is only applicable to massive influxes of refugees and therefore excludes individual cases
At present solutions where they exist are left to the discretion of the national authorities and they differ widely to say the least
What happens to nonsuited persons according to the terms of the Geneva Convention who would be in serious danger were they to return to their country of origin
Fortunately the majority remain within the territory of the Union and we will see under what conditions they do so
However we must not forget that some are sent back regardless of the danger and putting their lives at risk as several tragic cases have demonstrated
The situation is becoming so worrying that for example in my country the situation in other Member States not being any better NGOs which do not have a reputation for following hardline or irresponsible policies have set off alarm bells denouncing the ridiculous bureaucratic demands made on displaced persons reporting incidents of torture or degrading treatment
These organisations deplored the decline in recognition rates for the status afforded under the Convention and the tragic situation of nonsuited persons some of whom were convinced that their applications would be rejected and no longer dared to request refugee status
They advocated a change in our way of thinking and a return to a code of ethics based on precautionary action
As regards nonsuited persons who are not sent back to their country of origin what conditions are they offered
They are subject to national provisions in the host country which vary extremely widely
These range from those who are fortunate enough to enjoy genuine protection complementing refugee status to those who are merely tolerated and do not have refugee status or rights and whose situation is totally unstable precarious and constantly being called into question
Current national provisions where they exist differ widely in the various Member States and often even within a Member State
Who benefits from this kind of inextricable labyrinth
Evidently not the interested parties but neither the Member States which cannot expect asylum applications to be distributed in a coherent fashion and are faced with the problems that arise from the presence of less advantaged people in society
The aim of my report is to bring to the attention of the Commission and the Council the urgent need to make headway on the harmonisation of these complementary forms of protection and to define refugee status and rights thereby making it possible for those persons who will remain on the territory of the Union in any case to extricate themselves from precarious and distressing circumstances
These forms of complementary protection must not call into question the full implementation of the Geneva Convention and must at the same time be clearly distinguished from temporary protection
As regards the amendments the majority of those proposed aim to alter the meaning of the text considerably and in fact appear to conflict with the actual object of the report
Everyone will therefore understand why I am rejecting them
I would have liked to agree to the ARE Group amendments concerning the persecution of homosexuals
However I understood that agreeing to them could negate the lengthy consultation process with members of other groups and when all is said and done the final vote could be jeopardised
I will therefore be asking my group to reject them
I should like to conclude by thanking the many Members who have contributed to this report which I hope will eventually establish a practice in the area of EU asylum policy that is more in keeping with the international undertakings to which the Member States have subscribed and with the humanitarian principles on which our Union is based
Mr President ladies and gentlemen I am presenting two reports here today
The first is about the Convention on third-country nationals and the second is about the harmonisation of visa law within the European Union
I would like to start with the Convention on third-country nationals which is certainly the more complex legislative project
I believe that within a functioning European Union internal market we need to have close cooperation on immigration and of course on the rights of third-country nationals who are long-term residents
It makes no sense using Schengen and other provisions to abolish borders if at the same time there are large numbers of third-country nationals living here whose freedom of movement within the internal market is very limited and if there are in any case different immigration regulations in the Member States
This can lead to cases where some Member States admit immigrants who then of course find their way onto the internal labour market as a whole ultimately contributing to the impact I do not want to say burden on other Member States
That is why I very warmly welcome the fact that the European Commission has brought forward a proposal for a Convention on third-country nationals
I think that this in itself is a step forward
Unfortunately the history of Parliament consultation on the Convention on third-country nationals is not a happy one
You will recall that we concluded our discussion of this Convention in the Committee on Civil Liberties and Internal Affairs last summer and that the final debate on it was to take place in the plenary in September
At that point the Socialist Group requested that the Convention on third-country nationals be referred back to the Committee on Civil Liberties and Internal Affairs and I supported this
The reason was quite simple at that time a series of highly controversial changes had been made in the Committee on Civil Liberties and Internal Affairs and submitted to the plenary
These included an almost unlimited extension of the right to reunification to all members of the immediate family including grandparents
The existence of a partner relationship was to be adequate justification for family reunification
Opportunities for seasonal workers to repeatedly enter into rolling contracts were extended
The mere offer of a job was to be sufficient to justify immigration rights
Expulsion for serious criminal offences was to be abolished
All this would have led to overloaded labour markets and social systems in the Member States of the European Union
Apparently the very people who supported the amendments got cold feet and then quite sensibly requested referral back to committee
At that point I attempted as rapporteur to find compromise solutions
I believe that the report before us today is a genuine compromise and that an attempt has been made to reconcile the various points of view within the committee
On family reunification we have gone no further than the Commission proposal
Regarding seasonal workers we have given the principle of subsidiarity priority in the individual Member States
We have also been guided by the principle of subsidiarity in the case of making jobs available in Member States
At the same time and I always thought this was correct we have quite simply deleted Chapter from the Convention entirely This chapter refers to the rights of third-country nationals who are long-term residents of the European Union
We have done this because we believe that as its name implies the Convention should deal with immigration and not the rights of third-country nationals who are long-term residents
However we are at the same time calling on the Commission to submit a new proposal to Parliament dealing with the rights of third-country nationals who are long-term residents of the European Union in a separate draft because that of course also needs to be legislated for
Furthermore we in the committee have gathered from preliminary discussions with Commission officials that in view of Parliament opinion on the third-country nationals convention and in view of the Council reaction to it at first reading the Commission in any case intends formally to withdraw this draft Convention and rework it with a view to reviving it as a proposal for a directive once the Treaty of Amsterdam has entered into force
I welcome this and I am sure that it will also be welcomed by the Committee on Civil Liberties and Internal Affairs
I believe that a revised Commission proposal would provide a more appropriate basis for discussion than has been the case up to now
I would like to stress that I intend to reject the amendments tabled by the ARE Group the GUE Group and the Liberal Group purely and simply because these amendments effectively resuscitate ideas from the first consultation in September which I rejected for the reasons I have already stated and which I have no alternative but to reject again now
Let me make myself very clear if these groups amendments were to be adopted I would be forced after the votes had been taken to ask the House to reject my own report
That is why I am asking you to reject these amendments
Now for the second report on what is known as the visa directive This too has a rather unfortunate history
You will recall that the European Parliament gave its opinion on this directive years ago and the Council subsequently reached a decision on it
We did not agree with the text adopted by the Council for the very simple reason that although the Commission had submitted a mandatory proposal for a visa list which we in Parliament supported the Council subsequently adopted a visa list which was effectively not mandatory at all as each Member State was allowed to introduce additional visa requirements for other states and was simply required to notify the Commission of this
The result of this was that the European Parliament brought an action concerning the directive before the European Court of Justice and ultimately won because we had not been adequately consulted
The debate in recent months since this judgment was pronounced has essentially revolved around procedural aspects namely what we are actually being consulted on the amended Council Regulation annulled by the European Court of Justice or the original Commission proposal
We subsequently reached a compromise by taking the Commission proposal as the basis for our consultation but by also giving an opinion in our new report on the proposals mentioned in the Council decision
I would like to draw attention to a key political problem on which my position as rapporteur has always coincided with the majority view in Parliament in previous debates
This is the question of Bulgaria and Romania inclusion in the list of states required to obtain a visa
In my opinion Bulgaria and Romania should be deleted from the list for two reasons firstly because discussions with the relevant Commission officials and in particular with Directorate-General Ia have shown that Romania and Bulgaria have already met some of the conditions imposed on them for the removal of the visa requirement They have not all been met but a great many have
Secondly I believe that it is time for the European Parliament to set an example
You know that in the negotiations on eastward enlargement and in the run-up to these some states felt that they had done well but there were also other Central and Eastern European countries which felt that they had come off badly
I believe that it would be good if Parliament set an example by lifting the visa requirement for Bulgarians and Romanians
I do not intend to use all my speaking time
Thank you very much for your kind attention
That completes my comments on the two reports which I am presenting to Parliament here today
Mr President on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs and my group I should like to begin by pointing out something that has come to my attention
Following the approval of the Amsterdam Treaty our committee received several documents detailing the progress made in the communitarisation of issues relating to immigration asylum and refugees in addition to all the other work being carried out within the framework of the third pillar
This is something we welcome and look on as a step in the right direction
However my attention would not have been drawn to this information quite as much had it not been so easy to see that the progress made is not always consistent in terms of content and strategy
Proof of this lies in both the proposal the Commission is putting forward with regard to the entry of citizens from third countries and the other documents Parliament has recently received for example on the strategy adopted by the Council
In my opinion Parliament is not some machine designed to give out orders or amend each and every document we receive but it does have to have an overall view of events and proposals put forward by institutions in relation to this matter As a result I should like to find out what strategy the Council and Commission intend to adopt if indeed such a strategy exists and what direction we are heading in
As regards the convention as draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Foreign Affairs I should like to point out that we are aware of how important the way in which we deal with immigration is in terms of our relations with third countries I should like to make three comments in this regard
The first relates to the fact that we cannot carry out border controls alone We need the help of third countries as has clearly been demonstrated by events at Mediterranean borders and the troubles experienced there
We also believe that immigration is an important factor in codevelopment and we should help for example to provide citizens from third countries with the opportunity to study in the European Union and for account to be duly taken of this It is also something we would like to see reflected in the report
As this is closely linked to the content of the draft convention that has been proposed I have to say straight away that I feel that the rapporteur reference to the previous debate was inappropriate
I am under the impression that the report had been referred back to committee with its support and I also think that we have made an effort to continue with the debate because as I said before we think it is heading in the right direction
This is why the rapporteur comments seemed inappropriate
There are a number of things that we should like this report to avoid in particular
First it must avoid generating a climate of legal insecurity for immigrants and those wishing to enter Second it must avoid the tendency for illegal immigration which occurs because of excessive bureaucracy or bureaucratic red tape
In other words we must prevent people who could reside among us legally from being reduced to the status of sans papiers as they are known in France Nor must we be over stringent because zero immigration does not and will never exist
And in my opinion if we were to act in such a stringent manner we would be forcing these people into the hands of people traffickers
That is why we have tabled a number of amendments and reached a compromise these both represent positive steps forward on a number of important issues
As regards people who work for others we believe that entry into a country should be linked to an offer of work and in turn that the work contract should be linked to the opportunity to reside in that country or obtain a residency permit as opposed to granting entry and residency solely on the basis of a contract
To me this seems somewhat utopian
Certain countries such as Italy have already put forward imaginative proposals along these lines
As regards temporary work subsidiarity must be adhered to as the rapporteur pointed out
And as regards entry granted to people wishing to undertake independent economic activities I think it should be pointed out that countries that have quotas should be excluded from the rule provided for in the report
There are a number of points that I unfortunately do not have time to go into here but I should like to mention the fact that through the issue of family reunification we have introduced the question of exceptional cases
I should also like to stress that under no circumstances shall we accept the amendment tabled by the PPE Group which seeks to lower the age at which children have the right to family reunification to 
Lastly I should like to mention section eight
We believe that the Commission should put forward a proposal detailing the rights of immigrants living here to give them a status and regulate their legal situation
These are rights that all European citizens living here enjoy
We do not wish to create a Community with two types of citizens one with one set of rights and the other with a different set but in effect the rights citizens possess in order to be classed as a citizen in a Member State if you will excuse the repetition do not apply to immigrants We therefore believe that the Commission should put forward a proposal which includes these immigrants and resolves the issue of free movement for those legally residing here
Mr President two years ago in December the Committee on Foreign Affairs Security and Defence Policy called in the Oostlander report for the visa requirement for Romania and Bulgaria to be abolished
This position was supported by the plenary and was adopted again in a second report in March 
So Parliament has always been consistent in its view that the visa requirement for those countries should be lifted
Of course as everyone here this evening knows the requirement causes a lot of problems for people in both countries many of whom are increasingly seeking opportunities to come to the European Union for study meetings seminars exchanges of contacts and so on in the context of the enlargement process
This means that there are huge queues at the EU embassies and people face long waits often after travelling considerable distances to get there
In short it all takes a great deal of effort and is an obstacle to opportunities for direct contact
This is why we would strongly urge that the requirement should be abolished
Furthermore the countries in the leading group in other words those which have made more progress in negotiations with the European Union are now also planning to impose the same requirements as part of the adoption of the acquis communautaire so instead of becoming more integrated they are not only becoming more excluded from the Union but it is also being made more difficult for them to have contact with former eastern bloc countries
In my opinion which has the backing of the Committee on Foreign Affairs Security and Defence Policy I also draw attention to the fact that it is wrong to introduce a visa requirement for Hong Kong given that it does not apply vice versa and EU citizens are free to visit Hong Kong without a visa
It is also sending an important political signal to let it be known that the Union still regards Hong Kong as an autonomous administrative region
Mr President I am draftsman or should I say draftswoman of the opinion of the Committee on Women Rights on the initiative taken by the Committee on Civil Liberties and Internal Affairs which seeks to establish harmonised minimum rules that are uniformly applicable for asylum seekers not covered by the Geneva Convention
This initiative commendable in itself must not of course result in the European Union leaving its borders wide open in order to grant asylum to almost all the inhabitants of most countries throughout the world
However if we are limited to justified and necessary harmonisation my aim is to draw attention to the specific problems experienced by certain categories of refugee women whose situation is a special one in some countries
In the opinion of the Committee on Women Rights the harmonisation recommended to complement the Geneva Convention should cover special situations such as gender-specific persecution sexual violence and exploitation and trafficking in women where these put the lives and health of the women concerned at risk
Our intention is certainly not to grant asylum to all women in all countries because of women fearing sexual violence
Moreover there are also cases of this in the Member States of the Community
However where women can legitimately invoke the right to asylum in this type of special situation in their country of origin we urge in particular that they are granted a status separate from that of their husband or relatives and that they also receive special medical and psychological help All of this is along the lines of the conclusions adopted in my opinion
Madam President as you know this report has already had a remarkable history to say the least
This also accounts for why it has taken so long to reach the plenary but now at last it has arrived
The Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens Rights would like to see Parliament give its support as it has recommended to the amendments such as those calling for the criteria determining who should appear on the common list black or grey or whatever you will to be the same for all countries and accessible to the public
On the other hand these initial criteria should also include provisions allowing for the list to be abolished
The list itself should be evaluated and updated on a regular basis
There is no need for it to be set in stone
The question of compulsory visas for Bulgaria and Romania has already been mentioned and the Legal Affairs Committee has delivered its opinion
This concerns the applicant countries which are still in the process of membership negotiations but which in the meantime are being discriminated against
Such a situation is unacceptable
We should also like to have sight of the reports that were compiled by the Committee of Experts who visited the respective countries and on which the visa requirement for Bulgaria and Romania has been based
We should like to see these reports laid before Parliament since it would be interesting to see on what principles they are founded
Consequently we shall give our support to Amendments Nos and amongst others
With regard to the policy on refugees which is the subject of this joint debate on behalf of the Green Group I should like to express concern over the EU refugee policy particularly in the light of the Schengen Agreement and the fact that each year fewer and fewer refugees believe that such a thing as asylum actually exists within the EU
Should we not be preventing the walls around the Union from becoming too high
The Green Group believes that a generous policy on refugees in accordance with the UN Convention relating to the Status of Refugees is an absolute requirement
Madam President it is unfortunately the case that asylum and immigration are politically sensitive issues particularly in the run-up to elections
It is a great pity that they are increasingly being exploited for political reasons despite the fact that many political parties have signed up to the charter against racism drawn up by the Monitoring Centre in Vienna
It is obviously very tempting to try to curry favour with the voters by exaggerating the risk that we will be overwhelmed by sweeping tides of asylum-seekers and by playing on people fears that too many foreigners will threaten our prosperity or identity
There is therefore every good reason to regulate asylum and immigration policy at European level not just in order to prevent these sorts of abuses at national level but also because of the cross-border nature of the problem
Time and time again however the Council has disappointed us here
Of course when it comes to restrictive measures defending fortress Europe and passing the problem off onto neighbouring countries it is only too happy to turn a blind eye and has no problem in finding agreement
But constructing and harmonising a humane and fair asylum and immigration policy seems to be well-nigh impossible
This is why I think it is good that the Commission and Parliament keep putting these issues back on the agenda
Mrs Lindeperg report on the harmonisation of forms of protection complementing refugee status is certainly needed now that it appears that many people are falling through the net sometimes because the Geneva Convention is interpreted too narrowly and sometimes because people do not actually meet the criteria to be classified as genuine refugees but cannot return to their country of origin
It is often claimed that the Geneva Convention is being abused that the people asking us for asylum are not genuine refugees and that the asylum problem is beset by liars and criminals
But we ourselves largely encourage this by making the Convention the only possible way of getting into Europe
This is why I particularly welcome the fact that the Commission has looked at this side of the problem and considered under what conditions the nationals of third countries can be admitted
We very much appreciate the fact that the Commission and particularly Commissioner Gradin have asked us for our opinion on this
However in order to arrive at an opinion we have had to make a sacrifice because we were only able to achieve a majority in the committee by deleting Chapter 
We can well imagine that this will come as a disappointment to the Commission as indeed it is to us because it means that the basic objective which is one that we value has been nipped in the bud
Amendment No which calls for a status to be introduced for third-country nationals is designed to counter this objection
I hope that the Commission realises that my group at least supports its idea of improving the position of illegal residents too
We are therefore hopeful that a status will be created which establishes the rights of fellow citizens from third countries
Madam President Commissioner ladies and gentlemen my own comments relate to the proposals underlying trends and amendments emanating from the left of the House
They generally have one thing in common they repeatedly support immigration from third countries and above all an extension of family immigration and reunification with an overwhelming tendency to class all forms of partnership regardless of gender as a family and at the same time adopting an increasingly wide definition of relatives
The result must be obvious
These proposals also tend to facilitate access to the labour market of the European Union
For example one amendment suggests that the mere offer of a work contract should be enough to qualify for a oneto four-year stay in the European Union
The extension of refugee status is another issue exercising our minds
I am all for thought being given to this and for seeking solutions
However we will not find any solutions based on the very vague definitions we have of the groups involved for example if when we talk about groups of people threatened with violations of fundamental human rights we insist on categorising the right to health or the right to work as basic rights or if we include groups who are threatened by major disruptions in public order or people who give homosexuality as grounds for asylum
The net is being widened somewhat too far if all these groups are to be given the status of refugees wishing to enter the European Union
If you consider the extensive new appeal arrangements which provide that an appeal always has suspensory effect for all these groups even if there has been abuse of the system then you end up with similar problems as I have already mentioned
Regarding asylum I would also like to mention that we must of course give positive signals to states such as Bulgaria or Romania who are making an effort
However I know from my own experience of the Ministry of the Interior there that there are major problems with the justice system the police and the development of border security
We know that there is a constant risk of illegal immigrants entering the Member States of the European Union via these countries
We must help them to improve their border security
However we cannot remove the visa requirement whilst Europe has no guarantee of security
The effect of all these demands tends to be an increase in immigration an invitation to abuse asylum status and an impression that we are doing too little for refugees
This effect is unacceptable and that impression totally erroneous
What we need and we in the PPE Group are arguing for this is a comprehensive solution embracing asylum and refugee issues which provides for burden sharing and for measures to counter abuse
The objective we should be setting ourselves is to help refugees but to limit and regulate immigration and to combat abuse and illegal activity so that in future we can guarantee a safe and stable Europe in the interests of our all our citizens
Madam President I should like to make four remarks in the joint debate on the Lindeperg and Lehne reports
The first concerns the appropriateness of holding the debate on the Lehne report at this time
Mr Lehne himself said in his report that we can raise the question as soon as the Amsterdam Treaty once it has entered into force provides a more appropriate framework for dealing with problems connected with the admission of third country nationals
In this case however the Commission has exercised its right of initiative for the first time by formulating a position on the subject
Parliament has repeatedly called upon the Commission to give impetus to policies which come under the third pillar and therefore cannot take a favourable decision on this
Moreover the urgent need for harmonisation in this area no longer has to be demonstrated
Secondly the admission of non-Community nationals concerns issues as important as the labour market vocational training family reunification all issues giving rise to controversy which is sometimes very acute
In short we are dealing with an extremely sensitive issue here which if the case arises provokes emotional and impassioned reactions and is also very often the cause of irrational thoughts and behaviour
Words are therefore important in themselves because of the ideas they express and the messages they convey or rather suggest
Recent events remind us that regarding nationality as an ethnic concept for example would by its very nature wake evil spirits from the past and make it possible for parties pursuing this line of approach to win elections
It is the whole political class that is being questioned about the way in which it must take up these challenges
To summarise my view regarding the admission of non-Community nationals on the territory of the European Union in particular and general relations between European citizens and non-Community nationals I would say that there is reason more than ever before to consider how the debate should be organised and how to encourage reflection and to convince the sceptics
We need to show ourselves to be understanding and sometimes patient as well as imaginative and generous towards those concerned by the policies referred to in the Lehne and Lindeperg reports
In other words two different approaches are possible
The first approach which is based on populism and electioneering tends to send out a strong message to the more fortunate members of society and a weak one to disadvantaged social groups
The second approach which consists in giving positive signals to the vulnerable groups in society and less positive ones to those who are more fortunate seems to me quite obviously to be more compatible with our duty to show solidarity as is stipulated by the Geneva Convention with regard to asylum seekers
Thirdly and I thank Mr Lehne particularly for having mentioned this aspect we should welcome Parliament coherent attitude towards maintaining visa requirements for Romanian and Bulgarian nationals
Of course the Member States will probably not follow the conclusions of Parliament which calls upon them to remove Bulgaria and Romania from the famous common list
It would be a real shame if the Council were to persevere in its attitude
However without being particularly optiministic I hope it will respond favourably to our demand
In doing so it would merely be recognising the progress achieved by both these countries
What is more it would merely be putting an end to a form of discrimination which affects two countries associated with the European Union
Finally I should like to say that the policies at the centre of our debate are part of an overall picture
I am also the first person to regret that no progress was made on burden-sharing a subject to which a previous debate was devoted
This would allow us to progress more quickly in terms of the policies we are currently discussing
Madam President once again we are dealing with the important issue of asylum and more specifically protection complementing refugee status in the European Union
However we must remind ourselves that the Universal Declaration of Human Rights a declaration that is often cited and one that is presumably adopted by all recognises the right of any person to protect themselves against persecution and to enjoy asylum in any country We must also bear in mind that the Geneva Convention without restrictive interpretations must be the frame of reference for all national or Community regulations on the right to asylum and refugee status
On the basis of the content of these texts we strongly criticise the ever more stringent conditions that Member States are imposing on persons seeking protection in countries of the Union
Entry residence and the status of persons seeking international protection in the territory of Member States cannot under any circumstances be treated merely as issues relating to the internal security of those states They must be considered with respect for international conventions and a supportive policy of aid for development and economic cooperation
In recent years we have noted with some concern that legislation on asylum has been tightened up
This has resulted in a downward trend in the number of applications for asylum in the European Union and stagnation in the rates of acknowledgement of refugee status in many countries despite the fact that the human rights situation in the world has not considerably improved
With regard to protection complementary to refugee status we support the measures put forward by the rapporteur
They focus on the protection of persons threatened by widespread violence internal conflict or violations of human rights and lay particular emphasis on the international recognition of women who are subject to sexual violence
We also believe that it is essential to adopt measures to ensure the integration of refugees into society and to help them develop as residents
Lastly I should like to highlight the case of the Kurdish leader Abdullah Ocalan and call on the Council to make a determined effort to intervene in this situation
Madam President human rights and citizens rights are not principles that are infinitely variable
They must be applied constantly and coherently in all countries there must be no exceptions and no grey areas
In this sense Mrs Lindeperg report endeavours to increase throughout the European Union the level of protection for refugees and persons subjected to persecution
It proposes a useful complement to measures protecting human rights
With reservation we approve the need to harmonise at EU level the rules applying to refugees who cannot claim the status afforded by the Geneva Convention but cannot return to their country of origin for fear of losing their lives or being subjected to degrading or humiliating treatment
The definition of refugee status given in the Geneva Convention is interpreted in a narrow sense by a Council decision refugee status is only granted where persecution is carried out or encouraged by the authorities
Where the authorities fail to act the persons concerned are eligible for forms of protection under national law and this is where the shoe pinches and the measure proves to be inadequate
Complementary protection can vary from one Member State to another creating to all intents and purposes disparities with regard to opportunity of protection depending on the place where the individual being persecuted makes his application for asylum
This unequal treatment can have serious consequences for example where a refugee life is at risk if he returns to his country of origin
Harmonisation is therefore desirable
Moreover it will make it possible to establish a set of rules which will provide a basis for examining the forms of protection taken from the European Convention on Human Rights
However refugees benefiting from complementary protection must not be confused with immigrants
Poverty in a country may result in severe disruptions to public order or create internal conflict
Is a person fleeing this type of disorder a refugee with the right to complementary protection or an immigrant
This is where there is the risk of confusion
Harmonisation of these forms of complementary protection must not of course be an end in itself either
We must not only pursue a policy of education by constantly denouncing human rights violations but we must also provide development aid for those countries and regions where human rights are flouted
Mrs Lindeperg report corresponds to the notion of generosity to which we are attached and proposes solutions which seek to improve the rights of persons subjected to persecution by making progress in the area of the rule of law and in this case accepted standards of behaviour in Europe
However our final vote will of course take account of possible subsequent amendments which will be tabled and adopted in plenary
Madam President at a time when in many European Union countries asylum seekers are not necessarily regarded as refugees who are to be welcomed Mrs Lindeperg report is a valuable document
She is a Member of Parliament with the courage of her convictions
Migration is a social reality in the European Union
We are concerned about the tendency in some Member States to substitute temporary so-called refuge for genuine recognition of refugee status under the Geneva Convention
The EU should not harmonise forms of protection supplementing the Geneva Convention without allowing for a liberal interpretation of the Convention on the status of refugees
For this reason we welcome the debate needed on the Austrian strategy paper on migration and asylum policy
The report makes it clear that Austria so-called strategy paper is intended as a deterrent and is not suitable as a basis for solving the problems of migration and asylum-seekers because it confuses not only the various issues surrounding their causes but also the solutions to these problems
Of course there is an urgent need for coordinated action
The objective is to create approximately equivalent admission criteria for refugees by means of a common legal protection system so that recognition criteria can be interpreted as uniformly as possible
Mrs Lindeperg report makes a valuable contribution to this
I would also like to say something about the two amendments tabled by my group
It is our view that Amendments Nos and are not relevant to this debate
A debate about the future or the fate of refugees in general is not the place for a discussion of what has happened to Mr Ocalan
That should be dealt with separately
Madam President Commissioner ladies and gentlemen I should like to begin by thanking Mrs Lindeperg
The ARE Group has always supported her attempts to find a decent solution to the problems facing asylum-seekers and many others in this world who feel oppressed and threatened
We share her concern and we will continue to support her
We are in favour of harmonising legislation at European level in principle but we fear that it would be used as a way to consolidate fortress Europe with the legislation and the Convention being applied increasingly strictly whereas what we want is greater understanding for the huge numbers of refugees throughout the world and for all those under threat
We regret the fact that the European Parliament has been reduced to an advisory body on this issue and that we are not able to make a more decisive contribution
In our experience the Member States are the only ones that take the decisions and they are often very hypocritical about it
Very often they talk about solutions that need to be taken at European level while at the same time rejecting existing European solutions and pursuing their own restrictive policies
We are extremely unhappy that various countries are pursuing this approach and we think that the Convention should be updated to include a more modern definition of the term political refugee
We want new categories to be admitted to allow people over this very difficult hurdle
We want people persecuted for their gender or sexual orientation to be included and we want new rights for a new generation
We know that Europe cannot escape its responsibilities here and we know that we are weak when it comes to protecting democracy in the world
On the other hand we ourselves create illegality
It will always be more difficult it already is to enter Europe legally than illegally
And this causes distortions in our own society and condemns people to go through life sans papiers 
We want nothing to do with such a short-sighted policy
We want things to be regulated properly so that the problem can be brought under control
We do not want to be or to become a totalitarian state but we want to adopt a pragmatic approach in order to deal with current problems realistically
We have tabled two amendments which from what I have heard can count on considerable support
Mrs Van Lancker I am sure that there are a lot of people as well as you who agree in their hearts but we will have to wait and see if they actually vote for them
What is the point of going for a Conservative majority when we could win a more progressive majority here in the House with various representatives of the Liberals and our two groups
Madam President I have decided
I have to point out that we agree with the first Lehne report but we definitely cannot vote for the decisions in the second report where we thought the Commission text was much better than what the report says
Madam President the three reports on the crossing of EU borders which are the subject of this joint debate are very different
Two of them are the result of what is termed the intergovernmental method of negotiation they concern the draft Convention on rules for the admission of third-country nationals and the proposal for a Council regulation which was also negotiated by consensus within the Council which determines the list of countries whose nationals require a visa to enter the Union
The third text comes under a completely different category it is an own-initiative report produced by the European Parliament which proposes a wide interpretation of the refugee status laid down by the Geneva Convention
Yet just as the first two texts try to be strict on the subject of the crossing of external borders the third text clearly adopts a more liberal attitude and is inspired by ideas which it would be difficult to claim are shared by the majority of our fellow citizens
I will come back to this point in my explanation of vote
In fact it is as though this joint debate had a hidden agenda seeking to lead us to the following conclusion the intergovernmental negotiations unanimously concluded in the Council are the ones that produce the texts which are the closest to what happens in the real world
This is why for all crucial issues connected with the international movement of persons my group hopes that we stay with this method and reject the possibility of switching over to majority voting and codecision with the European Parliament as provided for by the Amsterdam Treaty
Madam President first of all let me congratulate the rapporteurs of both reports for having grappled well with exceedingly complex issues
As far as the Lindeperg report is concerned this is a very positive attempt to try to provide and encourage the provision of supplementary assistance to asylum-seekers
There is a lot to be said for trying to harmonise the social provisions which the Member States make in varying degrees and indeed for endeavouring to have a harmonised and common approach
There are some amendments which Mrs Lindeperg has already referred to which I equally would not be happy to go along with But we can end up if we accept this report essentially as it has been drafted with a very positive contribution to dealing with this issue
As far as the Lehne report is concerned I must say that here again I have some concerns it exposes the inadequacies of the convention proposals in that they are particularly restrictive in some respects but lacking in others
Not a happy set of proposals as the Lehne report explains
I basically want to talk about the report on visa requirements for third country nationals
Here I have a lot of problems and difficulties
I agree entirely with those speakers from my group who have highlighted the undesirability of introducing complex and difficult-to-operate rules relating to employment conditions and also the reduction of the age at which family members would be allowed to enter the country
The reference in the Commission proposals to the age of majority is correct and we should not introduce some other factor
But I must say and here I think I speak for the majority of British Labour Members that we really find it difficult to accept that the rights of Member States to respond to changed circumstances by introducing visa requirements should be removed
The difficult situation that we have encountered in Britain with people coming from Slovakia in the last year or so has led the British Government to introduce visa requirements which were almost unavoidable
It is premature to talk about removing visa requirements for people from Romania and Bulgaria when a number of western European countries are already receiving considerable numbers of asylum-seekers from those countries some of them with very genuine complaints
Much more needs to be done in these countries in terms of ensuring proper protection for the rights of their minorities before we can think of removing these restrictions
In all those respects I really could not accept the report as it stands and I shall be voting against those particular parts
Madam President the right of asylum is sacrosanct
That is enough said about the grand and noble principle
On no account should the right of asylum be changed in any way either in the form of a restrictive interpretation of the Geneva Convention by the Member States or through abuse of the system by interested parties
What we need on the other hand is an extension of the principles of the Geneva Convention by means of a regime providing complementary protection to deal with exceptional cases
However such an extension must in no way aid the interests of those who try to misuse the right of asylum and wish to throw the door wide open to all forms of abuse
If we are to be effective we need to find solutions which are pragmatic as well as humanitarian
We must firstly promote transparent solutions at European level and then instead of pursuing a liberal line of action seek sensible solutions which guarantee the right of asylum while preventing it from being misused
I do not think that the Member States are closing their doors to asylum seekers as is suggested in the Lindeperg report but they are rightly closing them to illegal immigrants seeking to abuse the system on economic grounds rather than on political grounds
By combating illegal and uncontrolled immigration the Member States guarantee the right of asylum and prevent our citizens from making asylum seekers outcasts
Yes to the right of asylum and complementary protection
No to lax and ideological attitudes on this serious matter
Madam President I fully endorse the Lindeperg report because it reinforces the right of asylum and provides an adequate response to the strategy paper produced by the Austrian Presidency which calls into question the international law on refugees guaranteed by the Geneva Convention
However I am opposed to the Commission draft Convention on rules for the admission of third-country nationals
In fact it proposes an admission and residence policy which conforms with the Member States most restrictive rules
This is particularly true in the case of employment since it makes national and Community preference one of the key principles of the admission policy
Was the Commission never informed of the OECD study in which it is acknowledged that there is no close correlation between the influx of foreigners into a country and the increase in the unemployment rate
I nevertheless admit that the adoption of certain amendments has made a significant improvement to the draft
However I am dismayed at the compromise amendment proposed by the PSEPPE to Article on employment
This amendment not only implies acceptance of the notion of national preference but it clearly vindicates the system of quotas which would allow each Member State to take from poor countries the manpower and qualified workers it needs
My group has therefore tabled an amendment to correct what I had hoped was only a mistake until I heard Mrs Terrón i Cusí speech
My group final vote will depend on acceptance of this amendment and I will be requesting a roll-call vote
The Commission draft convention does not augur well for the substance of future Community immigration and asylum policy as provided for by the Amsterdam Treaty
We must warn the organisations of the dangers of this and take action with them to transform the present stumbling blocks into proper reception conditions
I am taking pains to do this
I reject this notion of a fortress Europe which is inward-looking
We must put an end to this scapegoat strategy which the Minister of the Interior Mr Schily also talked about a fortnight ago in the Committee on Civil Liberties and Internal Affairs
However our French Minister is no better on this subject
He has never addressed the issue of immigrants in terms of the legal implications
He has consistently linked immigration with unemployment insecurity and criminality as if evil always comes from elsewhere
The danger of this type of xenophobia it cannot be called anything other than this is great for as Gorki wrote it is preferable to expect the best of man expecting the worst will only lead him astray
Madam President Mr Lehne report gives me the opportunity once more to denounce the excesses of Europe emigrationism 
Immigration policy is and must remain the responsibility of each Member State
I reject the outright harmonisation of immigration policies the right of asylum and criminal and judicial procedures that is advocated by Brussels
A healthy state is first and foremost a state which controls its influx of immigrants and makes it possible for its nationals to work and go out in the evening in complete safety
We will vote against this report which protects non-Community nationals and damages the interests of European nationals and which encourages family reunification even where a family unit is not legitimate or recognised as such in the eyes of the law since it talks about partners
What is more we want to offer jobs to foreigners when seven million people in our own country are unemployed or live below the poverty line
I would point out that according to this report a contract of employment will be sufficient to obtain refugee status
If adopted these various amendments will undoubtedly turn our Europe which is already an open door when it comes to immigration into a Europe where the floodgates are opened to what will become a spate of immigrants
Some Members of Parliament talk to us about populism electioneering and racism
But they do not live in the so-called problem areas
It is the poorest and weakest people who put up with this type of situation and this can no longer be tolerated
It is unthinkable that those who advocate jobs and security in Europe could support such initiatives which are destructive to our countries and people
I for my part will not do so
Allow me to remind you of the famous words of one of our colleagues who said that we cannot take all the troubles of the world upon our shoulders
Madam President ladies and gentlemen I am pleased that most of us in this House are not of the same opinion as Mrs Stirbois thank goodness and that the majority of us see refugees in a different light
I confess that I am now finding it difficult to keep to the subject I had actually planned to speak about that is Mr Lehne report on visa policy
We have been discussing this subject ever since I have been in Parliament
Our discussions on how to formulate arrangements giving people from third countries legal access to the European Union spanned the whole of the previous legislature
The judgment of the European Court of Justice as Mr Lehne has already said Parliament took this to court still failed to clarify the degree of consistency we should apply to this question
My group has also taken the line that if we want to retain our credibility we should give our opinion on both the Council and Commission proposals
But as we have found ourselves in a state of deadlock with the forthcoming ratification of the Treaty of Amsterdam we expect that once it has been ratified and the Treaty has come into force the Commission will submit the new proposal it has announced without delay and that the amendments from Parliament that we are voting on tomorrow will appear in the new proposal
Nevertheless I agree with the rapporteur that the procedure for granting visas should comply with the same requirements and procedures in all the Members States
The fact that there is a visa requirement for certain third-country nationals does not mean that the relevant procedures should be unjust or even discriminatory
Yet that is very often the case at present
People who need a visa for relatives or business visitors or for youth and student exchanges should be given clear information on the documents required and the time taken to issue a visa when they submit an application
We know all too well that waiting times of six months are frequent with all the costs that implies
The authorities in the Members States should have to observe clear guidelines in this area to make the process both transparent and humane
Article in fact requires uniform conditions and procedures in this field
We also hope that incorporating the Schengen Agreement into the Treaty will at last make it possible to draw up a single European list of third countries whose nationals require a visa for travel into the EU
Many members of my group also believe that both Romania and Bulgaria should be deleted from the list something Parliament has indeed been advocating for the last four and a half years
It cannot be right that countries with whom we have association agreements are still at a disadvantage and are still on this list
I often go to Romania and Bulgaria myself
When you see how things are going there you are bound to conclude that this needs to be changed because both these countries have already made great efforts 
The President cut the speaker off
Madam President even though the two Lehne reports are extremely important I am only going to refer to the Lindeperg report as it would be impossible to talk about all of them in the two minutes I have available
I should firstly like to welcome and thank the rapporteur for demonstrating her ability for dialogue and for constantly seeking solutions
Of course when such solutions have not been forthcoming she has sought to point out discrepancies in a way that I consider to be very constructive
The rapporteur is aware that many of us and in my view a broad majority in the House agree with her objectives
As she points out these complementary schemes of protection must be harmonised so that those who genuinely merit a specific form of protection but who do not meet the conditions laid down in the Geneva Convention can receive it
Therefore we must not lower ourselves to the level of popularity-seeking because this is ultimately the worst enemy of those who are or who should be allowed to enter under the terms of the Geneva Convention and those for whom complementary forms of protection must be found
The two amendments tabled by the ARE Group which Mrs Lindeperg wanted to accept and which I hope she does not accept are a clear example of this
I hope they will be rejected because they are really the epitome of what Parliament is not able to do
Whether we like it or not the Geneva Convention says what it says and Mrs Lindeperg there are other people who are qualified to interpret it apart from the United Nations High Commissioner including the Member States high courts
However this is something that appears to have been overlooked
We obviously cannot try to change the Geneva Convention and say that it protects homosexuals That would be impossible because in order to change the Geneva Convention we must use all the traditional instruments of international law
And were we to do this in short we would merely be prejudicing those groups and potentially even homosexual groups in need of adequate protection protection that is not provided for in the Geneva Convention Indeed the complementary measures we are currently seeking are in fact aimed at those groups
Madam President Commissioners I should like to begin by saying something about the Convention on rules for the admission of third-country nationals
Mr Lehne report and the Commission proposal are extremely important elements of what should become a common immigration policy
A European approach is particularly important here because the differences that currently exist between the Member States undermine not only the free movement of persons as Mr Lehne said but also in my view the rights that we grant to immigrants
This is why a European approach is so important
I must admit that the view that Parliament is putting forward today does not exactly fill me with enthusiasm
Even here in the House there is not a majority in favour of opening the door a little wider for further immigration
Of course I realise that this is a highly sensitive issue with its connotations of unemployment and social exclusion
But the main point is that there are still people even here in the Chamber who constantly manage to present immigration as a threat and as something that will inevitably bring an increase in crime thus encouraging xenophobia and making the whole issue taboo
I hope that some day the majority will support the view that migrants not only need Europe but also that Europe needs migrants if only for the sake of our own labour market and demographic development
It is important to have this report because these proposals ensure that European harmonisation will not be harmonisation downwards
The references to quotas and measures deliberately allow those Member States which have a broader policy the scope to implement it
We are not defending quotas as such but as some countries already have them it is important for us to support them
This also guarantees that families have the right to be reunited
We must learn to accept that people do not migrate temporarily these are men women and children who are entitled to a family life
I would like to say a few words about the report by Mrs Lindeperg on which I congratulate her
I am particularly pleased that there is broad support for this report in the House at long last as an additional status is absolutely necessary
Many countries such as Belgium only have a tolerance status with complementary forms of protection and this has particularly damaging consequences
It causes uncertainty for the refugees in question and uncertainty for society because having residents with no rights in an insecure position is not good for any society
So we really need an additional status in Europe
All I would add is that in December the Council of Ministers of Justice and Home Affairs put these two important issues that we are discussing today on the agenda for the forthcoming legislative period but with such an unreasonable deadline that there is a danger that it could become a long-term project or even be shelved altogether
So I think it is particularly important that Parliament should today send a political signal to the Commission and via the Commission to the Council that we in the House want to tackle these two sensitive and difficult issues and I hope that this will then lead to a clear signal being given not in five years not in twenty years but at the Tampere summit that we need solutions to them
Madam President ladies and gentlemen many speeches on asylum and refugees in Europe remind me of Bertold Brecht famous play The Good Woman of Szechuan in which the main character has to work hard at night as a realist to put right the damage she has done as a philanthropist during the day
We are being urged to drop the visa requirement for Romania and Bulgaria yet any security specialist can show that this would promote organised crime traffic in human beings and drug smuggling
Where does that leave our concern for our citizens security
Here in Europe we quite rightly accept refugees and people facing political persecution
There is no dispute about that as every right-minded person knows
However there are also numerous economic refugees who can neither come here nor remain here permanently and now Mrs Lindeperg is proposing that we should accept everyone coming from countries where there is widespread violence internal conflict or other circumstances which have severely disrupted public order
My dear Mrs Lindeperg this definition applies to three quarters of Africa and half of Asia
So provision is to be made for measures to ensure that all these people are integrated into social and economic life not forgetting that we have million unemployed in Europe and at the same time if they are rejected they can lodge an appeal with suspensory effect
Mrs Lindeperg that may well earn our respect and you may deserve our sympathy but it will not win our vote for your report
It is high time we limited immigration into Europe
Only then will we have a chance of integrating those who already live here and that should be our priority
Mr President firstly I should like to congratulate the two rapporteurs Mr Lehne and Mrs Lindeperg on the enormous amount of work they have put into the three reports we are discussing jointly this evening
I can support Mrs Lindeperg report without hesitation
It must be sensible when subsidiary protection issues will be an area of growing importance for the EU for Member States to operate similar procedures and a similar level of social provision for all refugees
With respect to Mr Lehne report on the admission of third country nationals one can only share the report view that the draft convention is unbalanced with unnecessary rigidity in many areas and with unworkable elements in others
However despite my acknowledgement of Mr Lehne hard work I have some problems with his report on visas for third country nationals
The main areas of difficulty are firstly the fact of his adding to the visa-required list a visa-exempt list secondly the ruling-out of Member States right to impose national visa regimes in certain circumstances like those we have experienced in the United Kingdom recently thirdly while I acknowledge the progress made by the Bulgarian and Romanian authorities in combating illegal immigration the reality is that significant numbers of Romanian and Bulgarian nationals continue to make poorly-founded claims for asylum in Member States of the European Union
Despite this however I intend to support the report primarily because I completely endorse the rapporteur view that visas should be not be required for individuals who hold residence permits in any state in the Union
As long as he continues to press the point that residents of the European Union should have the same rights and same duties as citizens I have to be in favour of this report
Madam President Mr Lehne and the Committee on Civil Liberties and Internal Affairs have spent a great deal of time familiarising themselves with the Commission proposal relating to the Convention on rules of admission and I appreciate their efforts
I have followed with particular interest the various twists and turns of the committee deliberations
Numerous demands have been made many of which touch on one or two issues that are absolutely central to the proposal It is those that I should now like to comment on
The first concerns family reunification which is a fundamental right laid down in international law
The Member States of the Union through international agreements have established the importance of the family for the welfare and well-being of the individual
This bodes well for agreement on a common line to be followed but as ever the question is how far should we go
The concept of family varies from one Member State to another and the same applies to age limits
In both instances my proposal means a step towards a closer approximation within the Union
The discussions in the Council of Ministers will show whether there is scope to advance our positions further which the Commission naturally welcomes
Secondly integration requires stability and a long-term perspective
The objective must be that immigrants are able to live under the same conditions as those enjoyed by European citizens a vision that should run through all the policy initiatives on immigrants
Consequently our proposal also addresses the question of the rights to be offered to Europe immigrants
In this respect my first thoughts are focused on the nationals of third countries who have lived legally in Europe for many years
In the proposal we have identified the following basic areas in which we think our citizens and immigrants should receive the same treatment access to the labour market and freedom to pursue an activity as a self-employed person basic education vocational training trade union rights freedom of association and access to the housing market and social assistance
We have also taken up the question of freedom of movement for nationals of third countries
For example it would be reasonable for permanently domiciled immigrants to apply for jobs that are not filled in other Member States
The alternative is a segregated Europe with all the attendant problems of discrimination social tension and instability
As one might expect the views in the Council of Ministers differ widely on this issue
Consequently I had hoped to be able to count on a clear expression of support from the European Parliament
Now it seems as though this is not to be which is deeply disappointing
Nevertheless I have no intention of withdrawing the Convention
The underlying causes of current migration are largely unchanged
People are looking for a better life for themselves or their children
There are no longer any uninhabited continents and migrants therefore look for places which they can physically reach
Europe will continue to be an attractive destination a state of affairs we should accept as permanent and normal instead of regarding it as a passing and somewhat dramatic occurrence
Furthermore a strategy for a common policy on migration is a natural consequence of integration and the idea that similar social and economic conditions should prevail throughout Europe with no one being left behind
I would assume that the ideas contained in the Lehne report will be taken into account in the forthcoming negotiations
Naturally the Commission will do its best to ensure that progress is made
Mrs Lindeperg in her report addresses the issue of protection for people who flee their homes but do not fulfil the requirements laid down in the Geneva Convention relating to the Status of Refugees what we sometimes call supplementary forms of international protection
The rapporteur urges the Commission to begin work at the earliest opportunity on harmonisation of the European Union asylum policies
I am sure the House will be pleased to learn that this work is already in hand
As a beginning I have put forward a proposal for a directive on asylum procedures within the Union
At the request of the German Presidency I will soon be submitting a working document on the subject
The aim is to begin discussions on the points at issue as early as the spring
Secondly we have now begun work on adapting the Commission proposals on temporary protection and burden-sharing to meet the requirements of the new Treaty
As you know we have been putting in a great deal of hard work on this since the Commission submitted its original proposal in 
The issue will be discussed for the third time at ministerial level during the informal meeting of the Council in Berlin at the end of the week
But despite all this the Member States are still a long way from reaching a decision
If there is no agreement by the time the new Treaty enters into force we shall have no alternative but to submit entirely new instruments
In my view this is what will happen
Thirdly the adaptation of the Eurodac Convention is another major task
Last December the Council of Ministers decided to freeze work on Eurodac wishing to wait until the Amsterdam Treaty had entered into force before further negotiations
During the meeting the Commission was also asked to submit a new proposal in the form of a regulation
Such an adaptation of Eurodac will mean a great deal of work and it goes without saying that it should begin immediately
The work on this area alone will take up much of the time between now and next June
In the longer term the new Treaty stipulates minimum standards for supplementary protection
This is in fact mentioned as a key point in the action plan on freedom security and justice which the Council approved on December
Asylum policy in general and supplementary protection in particular will accordingly be the focus of considerable attention during the coming years
Consequently the Lindeperg report makes a welcome and constructive contribution to the discussion on the future direction of asylum policy in Europe
Madam President my thanks to Mr Lehne for his excellent report
This consultation of the European Parliament completes the process that began with the annulment by the Court of Justice in June of Regulation No laying down the list of third countries whose citizens had to be in possession of a visa
We need first to put this into context
The regulation that was annulled was based on Article c of the Maastricht Treaty
According to that article Community jurisdiction in relation to visas is limited firstly to determining the third countries whose nationals must be in possession of a visa when crossing the external borders and secondly the introduction of a uniform format for visas
If it has to be adopted before the entry into force of the Treaty of Amsterdam the new regulation will be adopted by the Council again on the basis on Article c
That circumstance which cannot be avoided makes matters still more complex
This tricky situation has been well depicted by Mr Lehne and some of your amendments reflect this
My view is dictated by the evolving legislative context
I wish also to draw attention to the prospect of incorporating into the Union the progress achieved through the Schengen Agreement and its consequences for visa policy
I turn now to the amendments which I shall separate into two categories first of all there are many amendments based on the evolving legislative framework that I have just described and which I would roughly classify as anticipatory amendments Amendment No concerning the title describes the regulation as provisional
Amendments Nos and relating to the recitals include a number of references to changes that will be introduced by the Treaty of Amsterdam
But when we look at the actual articles of the regulation the amendments I have described as anticipatory are incompatible with the provisions of the current Article c Let me cite to you by way of example Amendments Nos and concerning the various aspects of visa issue an area that is not at the moment and I stress for the moment an area of Community responsibility
In these circumstances it is not legally possible for the Commission to accept those amendments which anticipate an area of Community jurisdiction that will not exist until the Treaty of Amsterdam enters into force
Secondly the European Parliament is proposing a number of amendments that fall perfectly within the scope of Article c these respect the parameters of that article but we do have to consider them paradoxical though this may seem in the light of the forthcoming entry into force of Amsterdam
I can explain this better by taking as an example Amendment No concerning the criteria for determining which countries will be subject to the visa requirement
The way in which this issue is dealt with viewed in terms of the existing Article c will be significantly different once Article of the Treaty of Amsterdam has given the Community the additional authority to draw up the list of countries whose citizens will not be required to be in possession of a visa
The prospects for achieving total harmonisation of visa policy something which Parliament wants moreover therefore mean that we have to look again at the issue wearing our Amsterdam-tinted spectacles so to speak
I do not however wish to be absolutely negative about the possibility of accepting the amendments Parliament is proposing as part of the new consultation on the following regulation
The prospect of the now imminent entry into force of the Amsterdam Treaty will bring about profound changes with regard to visas new powers will be transferred to the Community in relation to the measures to be adopted in these sectors
The Treaty of Amsterdam has set definite time-limits while the recent Commission and Council action plan on the area of freedom security and justice actually provides for more rapid adoption of some visa-related measures
The Community must shoulder the obligations its new powers bring with them and the Commission will have to assume its own responsibilities without delay
I can assure you that the work Parliament has done as part of this new consultation will not have been in vain
I am also certain that some of the proposed amendments will be largely taken into consideration in the new proposal for a regulation that the Commission has included in its own programme of work on which Parliament has recently delivered its opinion
I shall conclude Madam President with a reference to the question that has been raised concerning Bulgaria and Romania
The inclusion of a third country on the common list of countries whose citizens have to have a visa is based on an assessment of the main criteria involving the risks to security and the threat of illegal immigration
Having said that the assessment made at the time the regulation is adopted is not set in stone
And with that in mind the Community and Bulgaria and Romania have on several occasions in recent months had the opportunity of discussing this problem which has a variety of implications
From those various contacts through the association councils at ministerial level and through correspondence it has become apparent that Bulgaria and Romania are making considerable efforts not least with the help of the Union and supported by the PHARE programme in a whole range of important areas with a view to the decision that will have to be taken on their inclusion in the common list
Without entering into detail I would just mention the strengthening of controls at external frontiers the conclusion of readmission agreements with other states security of travel documents the fight against crime and so on
The progress that has been made is I assure you being closely monitored thanks to the presence of experts in the field
The view of the European Parliament will probably be a decisive factor as far as the Commission is concerned at the proper time once the Amsterdam Treaty has entered into force
Thank you for that speech Mr Monti and for the explanations you have given to the House
The debate is closed
The vote will take place tomorrow at noon
Classification packaging and labelling of dangerous preparations
The next item is the recommendation for second reading A on behalf of the Committee on the Environment Public Health and Consumer Protection on the common position adopted by the Council CCOD with a view to adopting a European Parliament and Council Directive concerning the approximation of the laws regulations and administrative provisions of the Member States relating to the classification packaging and labelling of dangerous preparations Rapporteur Mrs Baldi
Madam President it is once again time for us to discuss important health and environmental questions at an hour that is scarcely popular either with those responsible for the report or us who are involved in the debate
It is a remarkable coincidence that in Strasbourg environmental work always seems to take place on Tuesday nights
In every other way the report we are discussing tonight is very important
It concerns many citizens of the European Union since it deals with the classification and labelling of dangerous preparations
The topic is particularly relevant for Finland Sweden and Austria for whom the problem of regulating chemicals was a matter of concern in their membership negotiations
Transitional arrangements were made for all three countries allowing them to retain for a time their own legislation on chemical preparations which was more stringent than that in force in the Union
I have to admit that I had serious misgivings during the first reading of the directive
The position adopted by the rapporteur and then by the Commission was in my view far too lenient bearing in mind the dangers associated with chemicals
Consequently we had a fairly intensive discussion on the subject at first reading and as a result the outcome now looks quite promising
Many of the earlier amendments have considerably sharpened up the wording of the document thereby bringing into focus the health aspects for European citizens
It is particularly important from the point of view of those people who have to work with these types of chemical preparations every day
The obligation to provide safety data sheets means that information is available both on the components of the preparations and on how they should be handled
It is essential that everyone has access to these data sheets regardless of the size of the enterprise everyone is entitled to a safe working environment
Classification and labelling should not only be carried out where the danger is apparent or life-threatening but also where the preparations are allergy-forming cause irritation or are harmful to the environment
In other words the rapporteur has done a good job and deserves to be congratulated
The classification of preparations is not an easy subject to discuss but Mrs Baldi has certainly succeeded
Nevertheless I should just like to bring up a minor point if I may
Even though it was agreed in committee I cannot really see the point of Amendment No 
Perhaps we are only further complicating a matter which should really have left Parliament as quickly as possible once a decision had been reached
But the card has been played and now it is up to the Commission to make a move
For the future let us hope that many more alternatives are found to replace these dangerous preparations so that we can be spared having to discuss how they are to be regulated and concentrate on finding substitutes instead
None of these preparations can be said to enhance either the environment or people health in the long term
We must therefore begin by doing our best to find suitable substitutes
Madam President the title of this debate is so boring that many people must believe it makes no difference
But behind the words packaging classification and labelling of dangerous preparations there are some important rules for the environment and above all for the working environment
In practical terms the common position means that painters will now have information about what they are working with
From July volatile organic solvents will be labelled for their narcotic effects
You may ask yourselves whether this kind of information ought not to be a human right
The improper use of organic solvents was already causing problems years ago
In Denmark we call it the painter syndrome
Now we are going to get the safety data sheets for which Denmark has been campaigning for many years
We have finally silenced the oil industry which tried to block the directive with every means at its disposal
The idea that painters are less intelligent than other people has been dispelled for ever and can in future only be used in history books as an example of how a debate can sometimes degenerate for economic reasons
It should be clear to everyone that the EU is developing in the right direction and that the working environment and public health are now being improved which is the only way to go if the EU project is to have public support
We will now continue the good work of gaining recognition of the long-term effects of solvents on the sense of balance hearing and sight and explaining the effects of hormone-like chemicals
Chemicals are still on our agenda in the EU
Madam President on behalf of the Commission I should like to congratulate Mrs Baldi on a very worthwhile effort
There has been excellent cooperation on this highly technical proposal
Thank goodness we have finally reached the last stage before adoption
The proposal particularly concerns Finland Sweden and Austria and it offers an acceptable solution to the difficulties they experienced over their existing legislation on the products in question and pesticides in their membership negotiations
As we know this led to temporary transitional arrangements for those countries
At first reading the European Parliament supported the proposal underlying principles
At the same time Parliament had to decide on the amendments which were also adopted
The Commission was able to include the majority of these in the common position and the discussions in the Council also produced results
In the Commission view the common position adopted by the Council meets both the objectives laid down in Article a of the Treaty namely the establishment and functioning of the internal market and a high level of protection
Furthermore the proposal also takes account of the needs of new Member States
Consequently the Commission is endeavouring to ensure prompt adoption of the directive
Now at second reading Parliament has tabled three amendments all of which the Commission supports
The first aims to change the committee procedure from type b to type a which marks a return to the Commission original proposal
It so happens that this was the position we adopted in the Council but it was unanimously voted down
We still think that this amendment would make it easier to carry through the directive
The second amendment which we also accept is intended to clarify and improve a particular provision
The third amendment which the Commission had already approved at first reading was as you know rejected by the Council so we would like to retable this amendment as well
The Commission warmly welcomes the practical approach adopted by Parliament in only submitting three amendments at this reading
As I have already said the Commission finds all three acceptable
Naturally I hope the Council will also give its approval so that we can avoid conciliation
It is now up to Parliament and the Council of Ministers to make a decision
Thank you Mrs Gradin
I am also sorry Mrs Hulthén that there are not more Members here to follow the debate on this very important report but that is how things are
The debate is closed
The vote will take place tomorrow at noon
The sitting was closed at am
Approval of the Minutes
The Minutes of yesterday sitting have been distributed
Are there any comments
Mr President on a point of order under Rule Code of conduct
Last month Parliament rightly demanded openness and transparency with respect to the Commission yet Parliament at the moment is being hypocritical in respect of its own openness and transparency
What is sauce for the goose should be sauce for the gander
Rule and Annex I Article indicate that declarations of Members interests should be available to the public
At the moment the register is only available in the three working places Luxembourg Brussels and Strasbourg
It is very difficult for me to defend that when I receive questions in my constituency
If someone wants to look at the register they have to travel abroad
Mr President I should like to ask you whether you will give an interpretation of the Rules to say that available to the public means that it should be available in Parliament information offices
If you are not prepared to do that will you refer the matter to the Committee on the Rules of Procedure the Verification of Credentials and Immunities because as a member of that committee you are very well aware that it was the clear intention of the committee that available to the public should mean in each Member State
Mr Ford I will check the matter you have raised
In fact there was an amendment asking for the register to be made available in every Member State but Parliament rejected it
I cannot give an interpretation against what was clearly the will of the House at that moment
I will refer the matter to the Committee on the Rules of Procedure the Verification of Credentials and Immunities as you request so that it can submit the appropriate proposal if necessary
In which case it would be necessary to translate the declarations from Members which at present are only available in their original languages
Mr President you will remember that I raised that very issue last week in the Conference of Presidents
I suggested that given our insistence that the Commission is more open there is a very simple way in which we can be in the vanguard of actually demonstrating transparency on this issue and that is by attaching the declaration of Members interests to each Member particular entry on Parliament website
That would immediately demonstrate to everybody that we were both transparent and prepared in the public interest to put our record completely publicly on the website
Mrs Green I agree but I cannot give an interpretation on a very sensitive matter contrary to what was decided
It was not decided that these declarations would be public the House decided to make them available to the public
The Committee on the Rules of Procedure the Verification of Credentials and Immunities could make this proposal and if it obtained the necessary majority that would be excellent and it could be put before the House for ratification
This would be better and everyone then would have full knowledge of the proposal which personally I have nothing against
Mr President we all received your letter saying that the Bureau has decided to alter Parliament information strategy
From now on ten or twelve subjects of interest will be selected from the week part-session which Parliament press service section will publish
At present we have a daily report giving information on the previous afternoon sitting
Today report focuses on Mr Barzanti report which is most definitely of interest as far as the issue of information is concerned
I am worried what the impact on Parliament profile will be if only ten or twelve subjects of interest are selected from the week part-session
How for example will voluntary institutions acquire information on issues the press are not necessarily reporting and which are not necessarily the main news stories of the day
I am rather worried about this and I will be writing to you on the matter Mr President I would like a reassurance that this change with regard to Parliament press service will not lead to a situation where citizens are deprived of information on the work of Parliament
Mrs Ojala the Bureau took this decision after studying Parliament information policy It takes the view that if Parliament details everything that has been debated in the House then ultimately of course nothing will be publicised because the newspapers cannot publicise or different issues
If we want the media to make the public aware of the work we are doing we naturally need to select those issues that might be of most interest to them
This is a purely technical problem involving communication and the transfer of information
At the same time the Rainbow will be available much more quickly so that everyone can read it as soon as possible
Mr President we should spare a thought this morning for the victims of yesterday avalanche in the Chamonix valley which swept away around chalets
In this winter holiday period this incident should serve to remind us that the mountains form a specific area which rarely gives the European Union cause for concern
I propose that this issue be included in the topical and urgent debate during the part-session in March in the context of natural disasters
In the meantime we should send the victims and their families a message of support
Thank you Mrs Leperre-Verrier
I shall of course be sending Parliament condolences to the families concerned
Mr President this morning Parliament was besieged by police officers and others and I have read in the press that Parliament will suffer another round of sieges this time by farmers especially from the Alsace region
I wanted to ask you whether you could inform us what has brought this on what is happening and whether you have already had requests from the farmers that they should be received
It is clear that they wish to submit requests through the Members of this House and that they are not simply surrounding Parliament for the good of their health
It would be interesting if we had a briefing on this matter as farming is going through a critical phase and we have debated these problems on several occasions both last week and this
Mr Ephremidis it would seem that they are not going to perform any gymnastics because they are coming on tractors
Nevertheless President Santer Commissioner Fischler Mr Colino chairman of the Committee on Agriculture and myself are going to meet them to find out what exactly their demands are
Mr President I should also like to know what the European Parliament is planning to do about today demonstration
It is important that we make an effort to listen to the demands of European farmers and that we have a delegation ready to meet them when they arrive
I think the actions I have proposed would be effective
It would be a constructive move to meet the farmers who are here and to answer their questions when they arrive at the European Parliament
Mr Lindqvist I would remind you that Parliament does not have any forces to maintain public order That is a matter for the French police here
We have therefore naturally taken no measures in this respect
I would ask you all to let the matter rest now that we have given you information on this issue since there is nothing to be gained from discussing it any further
Mr President on the subject of Article and natural disasters such as snow and farmers I would draw your attention to the fact that yesterday in the Netherlands a country kilometres long we had tailbacks totalling kilometres
That is three times the length of our country with the result that nobody could get in or out
Could we not at some time Mr President discuss road pricing and how to relieve road congestion in Europe under the topical and urgent procedure
Mr Wijsenbeek I am sure you are well aware of the procedure for topical and urgent debates
If you believe that this matter is urgent you should ask for it to be included in a forthcoming debate
Mr President I should like to ask for your advice
Yesterday I had a question down to the Commission and today I have a similar one to the Council
In fact it was so far down on the list that naturally it was not taken
This morning I received the reply to my question and it was the greatest fudge and cowardly reply I have ever heard from the Commission
Mr President what recourse have we in this Parliament to such cowardly responses to serious questions
My question concerned the absolute destruction caused by the seals in the North Atlantic fisheries
It has now been conclusively proven scientifically and yet we here in the European Union are not capable nor even have the courage 
Mr Killilea I do not know what we can do
However what we cannot do is to go into the issue now as this is not the appropriate occasion
Mr President I find it interesting that Mr Killilea quotes scientific evidence
However on another issue I should like to know under what criteria you agree to meet certain demonstrators who come here to Strasbourg
Do you take into account farmers on the periphery of Europe Ireland Greece Spain or wherever who cannot get here
Under what criteria do you meet people
People in close proximity can come other people cannot
Mrs McKenna what you are saying reminds me of an anecdote
Once after a demonstration had been announced a Spanish minister for the interior said to the British ambassador Do you want us to send more police
The British ambassador replied No send me fewer demonstrators
Laughter
I do not think that Parliament is providing demonstrators or organising the demonstration
Therefore I cannot answer your question
Before moving on to the objections concerning the topical and urgent debate I should like to congratulate our colleague Mr Menrad who is celebrating his sixtieth birthday
We hope he celebrates many more years with us
Applause
The Minutes were approved
EMU and enlargement
The next item is the report A by Mr Barros Moura on behalf of the Committee on Institutional Affairs on constitutional consequences of EMU in the context of enlargement
Mr President ladies and gentlemen this report takes as its starting point the undeniable success of the adoption of the single currency after a rigorously applied convergence process
The achievement of Economic and Monetary Union with an independent European Central Bank is a quantum leap for the European Union leading to the emergence of a genuine supranational political authority with responsibilities in matters of monetary and exchange-rate policies that once belonged to the sovereign States
However the institutional establishment of Economic and Monetary Union has been unbalanced in that the power to centrally manage monetary policy is not matched by any real powers for the Union to effectively coordinate economic policies by means of broad guidelines or any binding multilateral surveillance
At the same time the inadequacy of the Union arrangements for ensuring transparency and democratic accountability in the activity of the European Central Bank has become apparent
In order to deal with these problems my report recommends two approaches one is to explore in depth the opportunities offered by the existing Treaties in particular through the interinstitutional agreement already proposed by the European Parliament and the other is to reform the Treaties now that the successful introduction of the euro has eliminated the risk that starting the review process might jeopardise EMU itself the famous Pandora box theory
The current situation that of a common monetary authority without matching political authority highlights the Union democratic deficit and also conflicts with national economic and social policies where a possible clash with centralised monetary policy could undermine that rigorous centralised policy as regards the need to safeguard the overriding aim of maintaining price stability
However we should also be seeking to guarantee all of the European Union policies including job creation and fighting unemployment at the same level
The report therefore recommends that EMU should be accompanied by effective means of establishing and guaranteeing coordinated economic policies in Europe so as to promote solidarity economic and social cohesion and equal opportunities among all citizens of the Member States
This calls for a constitutional framework the only elements of which I should like to highlight for the time being are an Economic and Social Union as a counterweight to Economic and Monetary Union and a new social contract to underpin intra-European solidarity This should involve a minimum of social harmonisation labour legislation social security combating social exclusion and creating jobs
The proposals on Monetary Union are intended to guarantee the independence of the European Central Bank while strengthening its democratic accountability
The proposals on Economic Union are essentially intended to guarantee effective coordination and coherence between the Union economic policies and those of the Member States by means of a set of binding policy mix policies
For that purpose given the shortcomings of the Stability Pact the recommendation will have to be replaced by a decision on the annual preparation of the broad economic policy guidelines and the multilateral surveillance of their application
As far as the institutions are concerned the report calls for Parliament monitoring and codecision roles to be reinforced in all areas of EMU
It also recommends strengthening the initiative-taking and political impetus of the Commission whose political accountability would also be improved in that way
It further calls for improved coordination of the Council work so as to give macroeconomic regulation priority over the tendency to centralise all powers in ECOFIN
And it recommends monitoring the formal economic coordination carried out by the EuroCouncil by means of legitimate democratic machinery and participation by national parliaments in monitoring EMU
As far as EMU external representation is concerned the report recommends speaking with one voice to be decided upon jointly by the Council Commission and European Central Bank according to their respective powers in international financial bodies like the IMF or G-
The aim will be to use the power conferred by the euro a monetary unit that may even challenge the supremacy of the dollar to economically regulate globalisation in such as way as to promote justice and to challenge the hegemony of the USA
Finally I should like to refer to the proposals for new European policies which according to the report are vital in view of the introduction of EMU
These are a guarantee that employment will be the Union top economic priority harmonisation of taxes a social policy promoting and safeguarding the European social model and a federal-type budget that promotes economic and social cohesion and helps us to tackle crises or asymmetrical shocks in one or more Member States
We do not intend to call EMU into question but we want this quantum leap forward to be mirrored by corresponding democratic progress in the political economic and social fields
Mr President ladies and gentlemen given the lack of time I will mention just three issues the coordination of national economic policies the legal framework for supervision and the external representation of the monetary union
On the first issue the current situation is unsatisfactory
This is because we were told in Amsterdam not to touch the monetary union title for fear that this would open Pandora box from which anything could emerge
This was just a pretext to hide the disquiet uncertainty and lack of conviction of many governments
However this problem which was pushed under the carpet then is now reappearing
We have one monetary policy for different economic policies
Clearly we should try to balance this situation from an operational and functional point of view but this is not being achieved
We were told that recommendations would be made represented by the infamous broad economic policy guidelines
However we realised straightaway that these guidelines were a disaster
This was because the representatives of the national administrations and national finance departments all decided to maintain the status quo and refrain from any criticism of the policies conducted by their respective countries
The result was that these guidelines have been reduced to formulaic and generalised declarations of principle which commit no-one
This approach was therefore a failure and has resulted in the development of totally divergent and uncoordinated economic policies
This situation should be viewed in terms of the striking contrast between the US economy which is bursting with health and the languid European economy
Since the triumphant introduction of the euro reality in the shape of inadequate national economic policies has reestablished its grip
I do not want to cause a political controversy but we must recognise that the fact these problems have not been resolved just because once again the majority of those in power are Socialists
The second issue involves the legal framework for supervision
There is not yet sufficient awareness in political circles of the enormous changes that the international financial markets have experienced
Politicians believe that the current system in which each country organises its own banking supervision is adequate
But times are changing
The Internet and globalisation are now prevalent and the instruments for supervising these financial markets are clearly inadequate even at European level
An extraordinary transformation is therefore needed mentally and culturally to cope with this
Clearly the current situation in Europe is unsatisfactory and it must change
I am not alone in thinking this as reasonable and moderate people like Mr Lamfalussy also share this view
I cannot go into detail on this issue due to lack of time Also I want to briefly mention the third issue of external representation
We have seen the results of this
At the moment the people of Europe are still incapable of speaking with one voice on monetary problems even though they have one monetary policy
We keep returning to the same problem of everyone wanting to retain their authority and refusing the Commission the right to speak on their behalf This means that in the or elsewhere we are paying our dues but we cannot make decisions or exercise any influence
These three issues must be resolved
I note that the Council is not present
I know that Mr de Silguy is convinced of the validity of my thoughts but it is the Council that must be convinced I believe that the Commission and Parliament would do better to work together in order to try to achieve this
Mr President in his excellent report the rapporteur has rightly pointed to the further problems of institutional questions in the context of monetary union but also of enlargement
We must indeed put far greater intellectual and political emphasis on finding means of resolving these questions in relation to the international representation of EMU but above all in relation to policy coordination
On the international aspect I would add that just as the rapporteur said we must speak with one voice here
But in this context we must also give the Commission as the motor of European integration and guardian of the Treaties equal rights of participation in this international representation
Parliament must continue to support that
What is particularly important is that we use the successful launch of monetary union in order to reduce the democratic deficit in the European Union
It really is time for the European Parliament to be given a codecision right that is consistent with the further democratic development of this European Union that right must apply not just to the annual economic report and the economic policy guidelines but also to the whole procedure for determining the excessive deficit and to the deliberations on the stability plans and convergence programmes
This is particularly necessary with a view to enlargement as well as to monetary union and the form it assumes
In this connection I want to point to one other matter
The idea of the EuroCouncil may be useful and may be very pragmatic
I am not criticising indeed I am welcoming the Council efforts to improve economic coordination and begin preliminary discussions on the kind of policy mix that can act as a positive incentive to growth investment and employment
After all the crucial point is that today we can no longer just have the European Central Bank responsible for monetary policy the social partners for wage policy and the states for financial policy
We need all these players to act together
The European Parliament must not be kept out of this interplay
The EuroCouncil is not an institution enshrined in the Treaties
So we really do need an interinstitutional agreement
I very much hope that the German and the Finnish Presidencies will find a procedure for including the European Parliament in these discussions and that we who represent the people of Europe can actually offer some impetus towards achieving a balanced policy mix that promotes employment in the European Union
This interinstitutional agreement is overdue
We called for it in and it must be concluded before the year 
Mr President ladies and gentlemen I quite agree that following the launch of the euro we need a more closely coordinated economic policy
This is urgently needed if we are to round off the whole project and make it effective
But I would warn against using the term counterpart
We do not want a counterpart to the European Central Bank rather we want to complement it
We do not want a political counterpart that runs counter to the European Central Bank search for stability for that is something that is beyond dispute and irrevocable nor do we support the attempts to undermine the Stability Pact through the policy mix
I think we must make it clear that this complementary policy of coordination is the key to supporting stability to making stability a prerequisite to ensuring that stability is not one aim among many others it is on this basis that we must pursue a sensible economic policy aimed at growth progress and employment
That is a different approach from the one Mrs Randzio-Plath put forward just now
We also believe that the kind of social contract envisaged is not acceptable as it stands
We want to see an approximation of social policies but not to opt for a social contract that acts as a counterpart to the European Central Bank
After all until now we have been pursuing a sensible social policy based on minimum standards rather than harmonisation and I believe that is an important aspect that we must not forget
Mr President allow me to make a final remark on external representation
We must emphasise the need to upgrade the Commission role as Mr Herman also pointed out
European economic and monetary union comes under the first pillar It is a Community task
But the finance ministers are acting as though it were an intergovernmental matter in terms of both external representation and the role they are taking upon themselves with the EuroCouncil
That is why Parliament should now make it clear that we will not allow a Community task to be watered down into an intergovernmental task just to flatter the vanity of the finance ministers
Mr President ladies and gentlemen anybody reading the title of this report would think it was concerned with the constitutional aspects of EMU in the light of enlargement
But that does not seem to be the case at all because there is just one reference to enlargement and then only indirectly in Recital A The rapporteur is not really concerned with enlargement and its consequences for EMU or vice versa
The rapporteur has used this report to argue for an enforceable and compulsory policy mix of social fiscal and economic measures which must be as mandatory as the measures on EMU
I do not doubt that the rapporteur believes in all good faith that growth and employment are things which can be decreed despite the wealth of evidence to the contrary
I and my group do not share this belief and a large majority of us will consequently be voting against the Barros Moura report
That said I should like to clarify our position
We support the European Parliament increased and more on-going involvement in determining global guidelines
It is just that we do not want guidelines to become directives
We therefore support the proposed interinstitutional agreement
We are in favour of social convergence but we do not believe these minium standards can be imposed from above
Finally we most certainly support strict and clear rules of jurisprudence
But we do not believe that a Council of Ministers even if it is made up of wise men can bring employment and prosperity to Europe by means of an enforced policy mix
Mr President despite the welcome I would give to the report by Mr Barros Moura to be frank I feel there is still much to be done and improvements to be made
I have three remarks to make in this respect
Firstly you say that there is no point in calling into question the foundations of Economic and Monetary Union
However in my opinion the current economic realities combined with social tensions and social and national conflicts will result in the contract being redefined
In particular there is a fundamental structural division in the legal framework and in our institutional procedures between the economic sphere and the social sphere This is causing the social sphere to be marginalised
Moreover you are only considering the basic minimums
In this respect there is one point in Mr Herman opinion which I particularly support the reunification of the procedures for coordinating employment policies with economic policies
This would be a very important step in the right direction
You also accept the budgetary stability pact in its current state
In my opinion we must recognise the need for public expenditure to be increased in order to finance development
This does not involve the budgetary deficit in itself but rather the financing of development Lastly with regard to the statutes of the European Central Bank and the European System of Central Banks you are only considering limited improvements
I believe that we need a kind of framework directive to regulate the European System of Central Banks
Secondly and more briefly you are staking everything on the coordination of economic policies
However as has been said there is a lack of will content and means
In my opinion we need a greatly improved democratic method
The role of the European Parliament in debating economic and social policy choices will become essential in coordination I hope with the national parliaments
This cannot be left as you propose to a simple consultation and debate on a single text from the Commission
Finally will the relationship between the European Parliament and the European Central Bank involve the Bank policy being legitimised by Parliament or a political force being established to counterbalance the ECB
We need a dialogue within a political framework so that the EU policies which serve social and sustainable development objectives will necessarily be involved in monetary policy choices
The work must therefore continue
Mr President ladies and gentlemen when this House gave its assent to the third stage of monetary union on May last year many speakers maintained that this common currency would lead almost automatically to political union which thanks to its own internal logic would remove the imbalance between economic and political integration in Europe
For those with the insight to realise it that was a dangerous illusion even at that time
I believe that today it is clear to us all that it was an illusion
Anyone who thought the common currency must and would necessarily lead to a common economic policy then to an employment policy and finally to a social union is now disappointed
One employment summit after another has failed
The economic players of European integration will not manage to create a political Europe they cannot because many people are far too interested in creating a market Europe and not a political Europe
Mr President there is a good deal to welcome in Mr Barros Moura report
Whatever Mr Voggenhuber says EMU will certainly have great political consequences
It is premature to expect to see an immediate and fully fledged economic and social union after five weeks
There will be great political consequences from EMU which have very often being underplayed or even denied by its proponents
Mr Barros Moura is to be congratulated for highlighting those political consequences
He is also to be congratulated on seeking to ensure that EMU will not widen the democratic deficit more than is absolutely necessary
No doubt it will widen an independent and barely accountable central bank publishing its minutes someway down the line seems to me to be utterly undesirable
However Mr Barros Moura makes various sensible proposals for ensuring that the democratic deficit is not too greatly widened
Nevertheless I have several concerns about the report and I speak here on behalf of the other British Labour MEPs
In particular we do not welcome the proposal to enshrine the euro-X Council in the Treaty
Already four EU members are not actually members of Monetary Union and as enlargement proceeds other members will join the European Union without taking on the euro
We must be wary of institutionalising a two-tier Europe in the way that entrenching the euro-X Council in the Treaty would
We also do not accept the need to harmonise taxes by qualified majority
Already not only in Britain but across Europe there is great scepticism and concern about the effects that monetary union will have and it can only be a success if it proceeds by consensus
To try and force people into tax harmonisation in this way will certainly not help achieve that consensus in the United Kingdom
For that reason also the reference to a federal style budgetary system was decidedly unhelpful anybody here who knows anything about British politics knows you must never use the f word in a European context if you are trying to persuade people to get more closely involved in the European Union
For those and other reasons the British Labour MEPs will be abstaining on Mr Barros Moura report
Mr President as spokesman for the Group of the European People Party I would like to close this debate by saying on behalf of my group that we are going to support the report by Mr Barros Moura
I believe that this report and our support for Mr Barros Moura prove that the consensus needed on the implications of Economic and Monetary Union does exist
I also believe that the decision of May is of great significance
As far as Spanish people are concerned for two centuries May has represented the rebellion against the French
However I believe that from on May will mean something else it will mean that we are building Europe together
In my opinion the most important element of the report by Mr Barros Moura is that it looks to the future
There is no doubt that the way forward is fraught with difficulties since we are building something that is completely new
I think it was Baron Lamfalussy who said that in the process of building a single currency there were more ifs and more conditionals than in the famous poem If by Rudyard Kipling
There are clearly many ifs along the path towards the creation of the single currency
Mr Barros Moura outlines the problems we are going to face in the future
He does this very well in respect of the role of the European Parliament and the new European policies
I realise that there are many things that Mr Spiers does not like he seems to me to be more Old Labour than New Labour However Mr Spiers it will happen in the end
Whether we like it or not we will eventually have to bring our fiscal policies more into line with each other and decisions will have to be taken by qualified majority
In an enlarged Europe with or Member States which is the issue Mr Barros Moura raises it will be impossible for decisions to be taken unanimously
Clearly what we really want is consensus but decisions will have to be taken if we want Europe to work
This House has always led the way on the issue of European integration and I am sure that it wants Europe to work
I believe that many of the points made by Mr Barros Moura are useful and will be useful in the future
We will therefore support his report
Cooperation on the euro requires self-discipline which prevents certain acts of stupidity and forces countries to show more consideration to each other
It is not a threat to employment
It will benefit employment and social stability
It is a safeguard against acts of stupidity carried out in the past to the detriment of prosperity and stability especially by some social democratic governments
But it is still the Social Democrats who believe they can protect us against the effects of the euro through new centralised control instruments
That is complete nonsense
On the contrary the euro is what protects us against old-fashioned social democratic policies of devaluation deficit and interference in the operation of central banks
For those of us who come from a country which has lived with fixed exchange rate policies for years this has been the backbone of the prosperity stability and employment we have enjoyed during that period
We look forward to being able to join the euro and so enjoy its full benefits
Mr President when we adopted EMU and the euro we thought that with the euro politics was making a come-back in Europe and I believe that Mr Barros Moura report proves this
I think that it proves one thing above all that the Amsterdam Treaty has already come to the end of its useful life and it is time that we took steps to revise it
This is in fact what Mr Fischer said the other day in Parliament and it is now being said by others in the German Presidency
I read in the press Mr President that there are committees of wise men already working informally on revision of the Treaty
I think that the European Parliament should be preparing rather more officially for this new revision with all of us participating in it
I think that Mr Barros Moura proposals are very good ones and I wish to highlight those relating to the interinstitutional agreement which could give a political interpretation to the existing terms of the Treaty to control of the EuroCouncil it is hypocritical to allow it to decide on policy and for us not to say anything on the matter and to the Community policy and the pact on employment without which neither the euro nor EMU has any legitimacy in the eyes of EU citizens
Mr President Commissioner ladies and gentlemen the Amsterdam Treaty has been mentioned today yet this Treaty was not even allowed to mention the institutional consequences of the transition to Economic and Monetary Union
We are now considering this issue and not before time If we failed to do so we would be allowing the intergovernmental approach to sneak in by the back door which is something we do not want
At first glance I feel that there are three essential aspects to this issue
Firstly as stated by Mr Herzog we need a closer link between the broad economic policy guidelines and the employment guidelines
We have been calling for this for some time in this House
Otherwise the social sphere will remain an appendage of the economic sphere which is not the best way to resolve the matters facing us
Secondly the external representation of the euro zone is clearly only just beginning
This was a matter of urgency and that meant that a solution was cobbled together which is not satisfactory in the long term
A more substantial solution must be found
Thirdly the transition to EMU and the changeover to the euro will force us to adopt qualified majority voting both in taxation and in the whole social sphere
I now come to the crux of the matter
The institutional consequences of the changeover to the euro cannot be analysed solely in the context of enlargement
They must also be considered in the wider context of the institutional reform needed
In this dual context the existence of the Euro Council is positive because it ensures an element of effectiveness which we need
However it is just being created and we must think about the future
We must therefore strengthen the democratic control of this body Given its effectiveness it must be controlled and we must determine how it interacts with this House
It must also be included in the overall institutional mechanism with regard to enlargement
The essential issue in the reports by Mr Barros Moura and Mr Bourlanges is the interlinking of these two questions
The ECOFIN Council cannot become the dominant Council and the General Affairs Council must regain its coordinating position
If this means that it no longer deals with foreign affairs then so be it
However we do need a Council to coordinate foreign affairs the economic and financial situation and employment but this role cannot be played by the ECOFIN Council
Mr President the report we are debating is moving towards greater centralisation of the economic and monetary policy of the Union and of the Member States which in my view goes beyond the ambitions of the architects of EMU who of course are not in this Parliament
It reinforces the institutional expression of a multi-speed Europe and in the name of a single economic policy it aims to bestow on ECOFIN characteristics of an economic government and on the general guidelines of economic policy a legal substance which will be compulsory for Member States
These are choices which strengthen the policies of imposing a centralist Europe and which reduce to zero the possibilities of Member States to shape their own economic and social policies
These are choices which give rise to concern among working people and the public at large who are suffering the consequences of the choices made at Maastricht and over EMU and the stability pact
It goes without saying Mr President that under these conditions we cannot support the report
Mr President ladies and gentlemen the report by Mr Barros Moura is to be welcomed coming as it does just after the introduction of the euro
It has come at a good time as it is useful to consider the consequences of Economic and Monetary Union and the imminent institutional reform of the Union prior to the next enlargement
The Commission broadly supports many of the proposals and analyses in this report
However I believe that this work must be extended by looking towards the future as Mr Méndez de Vigo just mentioned
And this is the right time given the operating practices of Economic and Monetary Union and the dynamic created by the euro in other European policies and institutions
In this respect I would like to mention briefly two points in response to your questions
The first point concerns the economic aspects of Economic and Monetary Union from an institutional perspective while the second relates to the effects of implementing Economic and Monetary Union on the institutional balance of the Community
On the first point EMU has its own unique structure as several Members have pointed out because it consists of a single monetary policy combined with separate national economic policies
This is why we need to coordinate these policies and why the European Councils have for many years been defining the framework for increased coordination of economic policies
However this is not a question of establishing counterweights as Mr Brok quite rightly pointed out
This increased coordination is based on a whole series of instruments with which you are familiar
These are the broad guidelines the excessive deficits and the stability and growth pact
However along with the Commission I agree with your rapporteur when he says that the broad economic policy guidelines must be the overall instrument for coordinating economic policies
The Amsterdam European Council asked for the broad guidelines to take account of the employment guidelines And since the Vienna European Council we have had the prospect of two complementary contributions one concerning the internal market the Cardiff report and the other involving the economic reforms the Cardiff report
Therefore the introduction of the euro has clearly encouraged and is encouraging the development of a genuine European economic policy programme
It is therefore the content of the broad economic policy guidelines that is important They will affect budgetary policies our level of competitiveness and the exchange rate policy together with economic reforms and structural policies both in the market in goods and services and in the labour market
All these elements aim to make our economic policy work to the advantage of growth and employment in Europe
This is a brief outline of the current legal and institutional framework As the rapporteur has quite rightly pointed out it is the Commission responsibility to see to it that this work is coherent by ensuring that the various components of this economic policy coordination come together perfectly
I note with interest your proposal which was highlighted by Mr Herzog and Mrs Berès to develop the guidelines for employment at the same time as the broad economic policy guidelines
Personally I agree with you but this is a very controversial point even within the Commission because it poses various problems
I am not going to go into detail on these today but this is why given the failure to fully resolve this problem we have included the content of the employment guidelines in the broad economic policy guidelines This will form the work for next June
To fulfil its task the Commission is clearly trying to ensure that this work is coordinated However the Commission is also responsible for constantly monitoring the economic situation of the Member States
This is why we are insisting on professionalism promptness and awareness and these are the instructions and the method being applied at least in the services under my responsibility
This is also why the services of Directorate-General II have recently been completely reorganised to allow us to assess the situation of the euro zone as accurately as possible using analyses and forecasts
We must learn to learn to think in terms of the euro zone
Furthermore we are currently thinking of organising economic discussions in Brussels in the form of study days in which this House would be involved
They would take place from this year and could be held at regular intervals for example once or twice a year
They would obviously be run with the help of top independent experts and would allow the debate on European economic policy to be extended
The aim would be to make this policy more visible and more transparent and therefore to contribute to the democratic debate you are calling for
Your rapporteur asks us to go further and to consider the scope of the broad guidelines with a view to creating an obligatory policy mix
You have suggested amending Article However I would remind you that the current Treaty already provides for the adoption of the broad economic policy guidelines by a qualified majority in the Council
Nevertheless I have taken note of your wish and the Commission will consider your proposal with interest In any event we understand the reasons behind it
Nevertheless this issue must be considered in light of the operating practices of Economic and Monetary Union which is only just starting out It must also be considered in light of the respective roles of the Euroand the ECOFIN Council
I had proposed to you that the Eurobe recognised in the Treaty but my understanding was that Mr Spiers did not agree
This is a problem which is arising now and which will arise in the future in the light of experience gained
For its part the Commission has always been in favour of improving the operation of the broad economic policy guidelines
These are not a failure Mr Herman even if this aspect is not as good or as successful as we would have liked
We will make more specific formal proposals on the broad economic policy guidelines for each Member State this year and you can expect to receive these in March
With regard to external representation an agreement was signed in Vienna
This must be respected and it is the responsibility of the German Presidency to ensure that it is accepted by our main trading partners and our main international partners
I have every confidence that the German Presidency will ensure that this agreement by the Heads of State and Government is respected remembering that this is a minimum and transitory agreement
The second point that I must briefly mention concerns the institutional balance
Mrs Randzio-Plath very rightly underlined the democratic deficit affecting the European Union in the context of EMU
I believe that an interinstitutional agreement is a good idea This is actually one of two courses set out by your rapporteur and something that was also highlighted by Mr Papayannakis
The Commission is in favour of this and has always supported the possibility of reaching such an agreement
In my opinion the practices already used in this respect should be made official and some of the courses mentioned by the rapporteur should be explored in terms of both defining and monitoring the multilateral surveillance
The euro will also have an impact on certain policies
I am thinking mainly of fiscal policy if only to prevent the tax race as it were
I am also thinking of social policy as this House must take part in drawing up the new social contract and in the actions intended to preserve the European social model
These are areas into which the Economic and Monetary Union will clearly extend although I am not going to go into them in detail here
I will end by mentioning the final stage that is the new institutional developments
EMU offers us the option of a method that involves defining precise objectives transition conditions and deadlines and ensuring a form of organised flexibility to inspire certain institutional innovations
This method must be given particular consideration with the imminent enlargement of the European Union in the context of our discussions on the institutional question
There are two key issues involved here
The first is qualified majority voting
Mrs Berès is right if we want to avoid the risk of paralysis in the decision-making system we must extend this type of voting and bring it into general use
However the problem with this as pointed out by Mr Spiers is the fiscal policy
A choice must be made between effectiveness and national sovereignty and in this case the dilemma must be resolved
The second key issue is the workings of the Commission the institutions in general and therefore the Council
Whatever formula is envisaged it must respond to the triple requirement of effectiveness representation and democratic control
To conclude I must point out like your rapporteur that in my opinion the euro can now act as a genuine catalyst which Europe can use to become structured stronger more developed and enlarged
Europe still has to be able to adapt and reform itself
It is in this respect that your report is an interesting and useful element which will contribute to the discussions in the months to come
Mr President I must just say something very quickly not to comment on the debate but to give Mr Herzog some information
I am pleased that you recognise that my report raises questions for the future even if it clearly cannot provide an answer for them at the moment
I am also pleased with the criticisms made by the Liberals in the House as they reassure me that I have chosen the right economic and social policy
I would just like to ask Mr Herzog to read Amendment No tabled at my request by the Socialist Group
This amendment deals specifically with the role of public investment expenditure which when calculating the public deficit must not be compared to or put on the same level as consumer expenditure
I appreciate that the Commissioner is being polite and diplomatic but will he not give an opinion on paragraph of the report
Is the Commissioner in favour of the euro operating with common goals or is he in favour of having a binding common economic policy as proposed in paragraph 
That is what I would like the Commissioner to give an opinion on
The Commission usually says what it is for and what it is against
Is the Commission in favour of paragraph 
I hope not but I would like to have that confirmed
I believe I gave a clear answer on this The broad economic policy guidelines must be as realistic precise and specific as possible
The ideal situation would be for these to be binding and obligatory but as the Treaty currently stands this is not possible
We must therefore proceed pragmatically which means initially using the system of group pressure and ministerial pressure in order to succeed in pushing through changes
This is beginning as noted last Monday in the ECOFIN Council with regard to the stability and convergence programmes
It is in the light of experience that we will see to what extent and in what way we can introduce an additional stage to make the system more binding
To be too hasty would be prejudicial and would probably be contrary to the objectives set out by those who are in favour of making the guidelines binding
The debate is closed
The vote will take place tomorrow at am
Decision-making in Council
The next item is the report A by Mr Bourlanges on behalf of the Committee on Institutional Affairs on decision-making within the Council in an enlarged Europe
Mr President ladies and gentlemen the main features of the report before us are its aim its scope its content and its orientation
As regards its aim Parliament through its Committee on Institutional Affairs has chosen to interfere in something which is not really its concern In other words it has chosen to talk openly and transparently about another institution namely the Council
Some have taken offence at this However we consider that this is our duty because Parliament must be concerned with the institutional future of the European Union as a whole and also because scrutiny is always much more thorough when carried out by someone else
Personally I would not have any problem with the Council preparing a report on Parliament
Secondly with regard to its scope this report analyses the decision-making process in the Council and in general terms the difficulties the Council experiences in its operation
It does not hope to lay down the full institutional history of the European Union for when this is eventually achieved but it is not confined purely to the short term
We have tried to define certain changes that must take place in light of the three challenges facing us These challenges are the political transition of the European Union the euro which requires an economic policy to be defined and enlargement which is exerting a quantitative pressure
In terms of content in certain sections the report proposes and recommends institutional reforms affecting the Treaties
In other sections less extensive interinstitutional changes and even administrative changes are suggested
We believe that the Council operates as a whole regardless of the legal instruments used
There are certainly only a few reforms that affect the Treaties but all the changes to be made to the Council operation are very important
The final key feature of the report is its orientation It aims to protest against certain drifts that are becoming evident and I will mention two instances
The first is a drift towards paralysis linked in particular to an increase in the number of participants without the necessary reforms
And this is related to the whole problem of qualified majority voting The second is a drift towards the use of informal procedures ad hoc committees and meetings between staff or between governments which are tending to bypass the effective transparent and democratic procedures laid down in the Treaty
What we want to see is more formality and stricter respect for official procedures
The report is divided into two main sections relating to structures and procedures
I clearly do not have time to go into them in detail
However with regard to structures I must stress a point that Mrs Berès rightly made and that relates to the crisis of the General Affairs Council
The report recommends a very clear separation between the foreign affairs function which must be carried out by the foreign ministers and the general affairs function which is a coordinating function to be carried out by ministers close to the coordinating authority
This is an important point
Indeed there is nothing to prevent the foreign ministers from fulfilling this role if that is what the Member States want
With regard to the procedures we are rather concerned about the limits on the extension of qualified majority voting
The report makes rather daring proposals on own resources and foreign policy which will perhaps not be accepted by our colleagues However we must realise that in the Europe of the future everything subject to unanimity will be paralysed
More generally the report calls on each of us to participate in the logical distribution of roles between the Council and the Commission
We are currently helping to create two parallel executive structures which is not advisable
The Commission must be responsible for proposing and implementing in all areas
The Council must be responsible for making provisions but does not need to propose and implement while the Commission must not assume parallel functions of government
Our message is that we must clarify this distribution of roles
Mr President I would like to speak on a point of order
As Mr Bourlanges rightly pointed out the Council is at the heart of this debate
I would therefore like to ask the President of Parliament to tell us who is now representing the Council in this debate
Mrs Izquierdo Rojo the Chair shares your sentiment that the Council should be here today
However this was not scheduled the Council was not informed and is therefore not present
That is all I have to say
Mr President there is no issue of greater importance for the future of the Union as we move to have over twenty Member States as will be the case in the next few years than the reform of the decision-taking procedures within the Council
That is why it is legitimate for Parliament to examine this question
The very functioning of an enlarged European Union will depend on the answers brought to the questions raised in this report
We know that as we soon will havesomething states around the table of the Council any area that requires unanimity will be an area in which the European Union is likely to be paralysed
If it can take decisions they will be slow cumbersome and on the basis of the lowest common denominator
That is why reform is essential
Any policy area subject to unanimity will be blocked
But on top of that the very functioning of the European Union can so easily be brought to a halt by a single government if it choses to do so
Take appointments to appoint the President of the Commission to appoint the Governor of the Central Bank even to appoint a member of the Court of Auditors requires unanimity in the Council
A single government may well be tempted to hold the Union hostage
After all we have seen this in the past
The former Conservative British Government a few years ago in the dispute over mad cow disease blocked all decision-taking in the Council that required unanimity in pursuit of a particular dispute
Who is to say that when we havesomething states around the table that sometime some government or another will not be tempted to use a similar tactic
We also saw the difficulty of wrangles over the appointment of the Central Bank Governor recently and over the President of the Commission four years ago
In both cases a single government was able to hold up proceedings to make the others pay a political price for an eventual concession that was made or a new compromise that had to be found
It was very difficult
Imagine that with more than Member States
That is why the first and most essential reform is a massive extension of qualified majority voting
Without that enlargement will be a hazardous exercise and risks bringing us to paralysis
Yes we must look also at the question of the weighting of votes in the Council
There is a proposal to have a double majority system a majority of votes and a majority of the population or a majority of states and of population
Mr Bourlanges report underlines that that is not strictly necessary to avoid the possibility of a qualified majority being composed of states representing a minority of the population
Arithmetically that cannot happen
That is why I and up until now my group have always been very reticent about the idea of moving towards a system of double majority in the Council
The Council should have votes representing the states just as Parliament has a more proportional system representing the population of the European Union
In this report Parliament is fulfilling its traditional role of looking ahead being a little bit adventurous but looking to the future as we did with Spinelli report that preceded the Single Act the Martin report that preceded Maastricht and the Bourlanges report which preceded Amsterdam
We know that there will be new intergovernmental negotiations to reform the treaties on these points
It is right that we put something forward-looking on the table
Of course there will be problems on specific points
My own group has problems and will be tabling amendments and requesting split votes on particular points
But if it is understood that Parliament is fulfilling its visionary role here looking to the future putting the problems on the table pushing governments to go further rather than being reticent then there will be an understanding of the role of this report and I congratulate the rapporteur for the tremendous efforts that he has put into it
Mr President Mr Corbett has given Mr Bourlanges report the best possible praise by comparing it to the Spinelli report
I believe that the two reports have something in common they both concentrate on the future and propose courageous solutions
And that is indeed welcome
I believe that just as in the case of this morning report by Mr Barros Moura what we are actually doing here before the Treaty of Amsterdam is ratified by all the Member States is looking to the future which is one of Parliament tasks
I agree with the comments made here regarding the extension of qualified majority voting
That is the major challenge facing us particularly since this report has been drawn up with an enlarged Europe in mind
Since the accession of the last three Member States the difficulties involved in decision-making have increased
What will happen when Europe has or Member States
We must provide solutions find ways of preventing paralysis and work to ensure that the European Union does not turn into an intergovernmental organisation
Our most important task is to defend the principle of integration
And when we eventually have or Member States the principle of integration will only be able to be maintained if decisions are taken by qualified majority
There is no doubt about this and we will have to ensure that it happens one way or another
In this respect I believe that the report by Mr Bourlanges hits the nail on the head in terms of the sensitive issues to be dealt with
I am sorry that the Council is not represented here because I think that it would learn from this debate and the points made during it
The issue of the weighting of votes is one of the areas included in the Protocol on the institutions in the Treaty of Amsterdam In addition the German Presidency seems to want to make some kind of proposal in this area
I believe that we must look at two possibilities giving new weighting to the votes or creating a simple double majority system as proposed by Mr Bourlanges He is from a country that has always opposed this idea and I think it is admirable that he has considered it in his report
As a result and because we believe that this is an important report my group will vote in favour
Mr President ladies and gentlemen I usually defend the unanimity rule but not this time
The rapporteur Mr Bourlanges whom I respect but with whom I basically disagree declares in his latest report that this is a conservative report
In my opinion anyone familiar with thinking on Europe will know that while he might be accused of a certain cautiousness he can scarcely be labelled a conservative
That is why now that the debate over who is pro-European and who is anti-European has become fairly meaningless and now that Eurosocialists are asking for more Europe we who are neither on the left nor Socialists are best placed to propose and actually achieve a better Europe
A better Europe at institutional level the subject of this report quite simply means that the Council should be in charge of Europe political management since that is where the Union of States and the primacy of sovereign States come together
It should be the European Parliament that supervises the executive actions of the Union in a seamless and close connection with national parliaments The Commission should in our view be given back its original implementation and administration role instead of trying to grant it new tasks new prerogatives and new powers
The rapporteur also claims that the European Council has become the vanguard of the European Union
We could not agree more
But here too the conservative side of this report gives way to the bolder side with the suggestion that the European Council should meet whenever necessary as the Heads of State and Government when for decision-making purposes it should adopt the procedures usually followed at normal meetings of Councils of Ministers
I am no Europhobe nor am I Euroallergic
I think that first and foremost we have to explain to the citizens of Europe as a matter of urgency the kind of Europe we have and the kind of Europe we want
I have already been called a Eurorealist for taking that stance despite my optimism
That adjective is not to my liking but I would rather be a Eurorealist than a Eurocentralist Eurofederalist or most certainly a Eurosocialist
Mr President I should like to congratulate Mr Bourlanges on this own-initiative report which makes very interesting though sometimes quite demanding reading
I entirely agree that we should be directing our efforts towards establishing a system that is clear and simple and eliminating any ambiguity as to who has responsibility and authority
The present confusion over roles which is all too obvious is of course to be criticised
Informal networking and meetings behind closed doors with no democratic control is also unsatisfactory
Furthermore we know that the second pillar is unsound a situation which is totally unacceptable
On this much we are all agreed
Might I be permitted with all due respect to call into question Mr Bourlanges analysis of the situation and the basis of his reasoning
He considers that the Member States have reacted to the new challenges with an excessively ad hoc approach to the institutional question this approach has led to the rampant de-institutionalisation of the Union
But is this really the case
On the contrary I believe that the new Treaty and institutional arrangements go in quite another direction
However a much-needed reform which should be implemented is the apportionment of roles in other words the allocation of decision-making responsibility
In my view we should return some of the decision-making that is currently carried out at EU level to the Member States and the regions
Furthermore there is no good reason why the European Council should play a less central role nor would it be legitimate for the Commission to develop into a European executive as envisaged in Mr Bourlanges proposal
The European Union is the sum total of its Member States and even if unanimity has not always been an effective arrangement the aim was that it should not just be effective but also democratic
I do not say that the Committee on Institutional Affairs was wrong to take an interest in an area which does not really concern it but let us accept this report for what it is an intellectual exercise
Mr President ladies and gentlemen I would also have taken this opportunity to welcome the Presidency-in-Office but unfortunately I cannot as there are no representatives present
Firstly on behalf of the ARE Group I must congratulate Mr Bourlanges on his important work particularly as he has managed to include in his report the essence of many suggestions made by his colleagues in the Committee on Institutional Affairs
My group therefore regards this report as an excellent starting point
There is currently a lack of transparency in the European Union due for the most part to the dual nature of the Council which can meet as an executive body and as a legislative body
This situation poses a problem which could worsen with enlargement in that in its legislative function the Council operates more like the Congress of Vienna than a real legislative house
Our fellow citizens must be able to understand the European Union institutional system
This is definitely not the case at the moment Therefore the Council must no longer be a gathering of national executives meeting in secret and deciding virtually everything unanimously
It must become a second legislative house just like the European Parliament
We also need to find a new balance for the institutions and this will put an end to the constant strengthening of the Council and the European Council
The latter must extend its role of laying down general guidelines and providing political impetus for the Union without becoming a decision-making body
The bases of this new structure mean extending qualified majority voting in the Council In the Treaty there are still no less than articles on which unanimity continues to be the rule
This means that there are many areas in which given the prospect of enlargement the European Union is virtually condemned to paralysis
We feel that the report by Mr Bourlanges can be improved further
This is why my group has tabled two amendments which we would ask the rapporteur to consider
The first amendment involves the urgent need to use the Community method to prepare the next revision of the Treaties It became apparent during the negotiations on the Maastricht and Amsterdam Treaties that the intergovernmental method was unsuitable ineffective and even out of date
The second amendment relates to the opportunity we have to consider creating a new function that of President of the Union in order to add a degree of permanence and to allow greater visibility in an enlarged Union
I hope that these constructive proposals will be adopted by the majority of Members
Mr President the report before us today was written by the French chairman of the Europe Movement according to the formula much more Union
The June Movement is opposed to union so we are voting no
Mr Bourlanges wants many more laws to be adopted by a majority decision in the Council of Ministers but that means democracy can be outvoted because the essence of democracy is that you can go to the polls elect a new government and change the law
The report proposal means that we can go to the polls but that we as Danish voters will never again be able to change the law
We can replace three out of votes in the Council of Ministers
We can replace out of Members of the European Parliament but we can never again as voters decide to bring in a new law
We can get new politicians but not a new policy
We shall be transformed into an electoral district instead of a nation
We shall become a national minority instead of an independent people
The June Movement does not want to reduce democracy
Our mission is a Europe of democracies in which each country cooperates closely but which only adopts common laws on issues which transcend borders
Air pollution and marine pollution are problems which we cannot solve individually
Here we need to have binding international cooperation but they should be minimum rules giving everyone the right to go further
The EU should not be able to forbid a country from banning pesticides and colourings which cause allergies
We want an environmental Europe but not more union and certainly not a new state so we are voting against the Bourlanges report
Mr President my apologies for being somewhat late I had another engagement
To Mr Bonde I wish to say that he is at the wrong debate
We are not talking about Europe general position we are talking about the Council of Ministers
I welcome the excellent report produced by our colleague Mr Bourlanges It is consistent and very coherent
The institution where we find the greatest difficulties in decision-making is not the Commission or Parliament although there are a number of difficulties of which we are aware it is the Council of Ministers
Mr Bourlanges spoke about the rampant deinstitutionalisation of the Council of Ministers and that is exactly right
The Council does not even follow its own rules
He spoke about the European Council as the Tour de France broom-wagon
Indeed the European Council is becoming increasingly inconsistent and it is against that background that I very much welcome the overall approach of Mr Bourlanges
I wish to make two essential points the qualified majority is a problem and Commissioner Oreja is aware of how the Commission has been fighting to obtain the necessary changes here
The point about internal coherence relates to the fact that there are too many specialised councils as Mr Bourlanges said and the Foreign Affairs Council fails to play its proper role
The suggestion that we establish a real General Affairs Council strengthens coherence I hope that the Commission will also stress this point
Then we have the proliferation of committees
Unfortunately we have a first a second and a third pillar but as we move towards communitarisation for instance in the area of Justice and Home Affairs it makes no sense to retain a committee of some kind in the first pillar
It erodes the initiative power of the Commission as well as the role of COREPER the central body that prepares the work of the Council of Ministers
I endorse that view also
Turning to the political committee we should move in that direction
But there everything depends on whether the CFSP finally becomes a real common foreign and security policy
Mr President ladies and gentlemen today we are supposed to point the way institutionally
Where do we stand where do we want to go
We are about to see the conclusion of the ratification procedure and the entry into force of the Amsterdam Treaty
As we know the last intergovernmental conference did not manage to resolve some of the important issues relating to the forthcoming enlargements
So the German Presidency is seeking a procedural decision on the necessary institutional reforms at the summit this June once agreement has been reached on the key questions of Agenda at the end of March
The European Parliament outlined the scope and direction of these reforms in its MTsatsos resolution
In its programme of activities over the past year and a half the Committee on Institutional Affairs has clarified the direction to be pursued
The result is the three reports we are debating today
The Bourlanges report contains a resolution that departs from the norm
It is not a list of demands but an important prospective document
Its key concern is the need to move to majority decisions in more areas and to adjust the voting procedures in the Council so that it will retain its ability to act even after the forthcoming enlargements
These tasks derive from the Treaty of Amsterdam and the positions the European Parliament has adopted thereon
Let me say openly that in my view the significance of some of the details of today resolution is a rather more illustrative one
In the current stage of the European debates the general guidelines require political authority
In that way we and Jean-Louis Bourlanges will live up to our view of ourselves as giving impetus to the European integration process
It follows that the next European Parliament will also have to debate the next round of institutional reforms in more depth
Here we expect the Cologne European Council to consider our ideas too when it decides the timetable and methods of these reforms
Jean-Louis Bourlanges has done very good preliminary work in this respect
Mr President Mr Bourlanges report which has cast a stone in the stagnant waters of the institutional bodies is worthy of our praise both for its audacity and its realism
Time forces me to confine myself to highlighting the effort to drive out the lethargy and to dispel the confusion which over the years have stood in the way of a coherent common foreign and security policy taking shape
Such a policy is a sine qua non for what we have been rushing headlong since March to call the European Union to be a real union of states and citizens
Not only has the aspiration contained in the original Treaty not been fulfilled by the revision of the Amsterdam Treaty but it has on the contrary been undermined
It has become even more complicated and obscure
Since the enlargement procedure has begun it would be dangerous to delay finding a solution to existing institutional indecision
It is quite symptomatic and yet sad that we have recently begun to hear nationalistic outpourings from heads of Member States
This regression simply means that individual interests are being supported at the expense of Community interests
Paragraph of the Bourlanges report contains specific and unambiguous proposals to check this slippery slide
We may not agree with one or two technical details What none of us can accept however is to allow the acknowledged inability of the EU to fulfil its supranational role of ensuring international order and peace to be concealed behind a wall of silence
Mr President the political testament of Mr Bourlanges coming just before the end of our mandate contains some important points
However only when the euro is a success and the national parliaments are prepared to provide a good foundation for the Europe of Nations do I believe the time will have come to take major new steps forward
In the meantime it remains to be seen whether a common approach to crime asylum for refugees the harmonisation of fiscal policy and the creation of jobs is going to be successful
Nevertheless European ideas for deepening European institutions and enlargement must be further developed But let us not overwhelm the public with too many changes in too many different fields as this obscures their control over and insight into their own sovereignty and that is more likely to lead to a rejection of Europe than the contrary
The Bourlanges report is an interesting intellectual exercise but we must not force the pace with giant steps but rather take the slow road like Tom Thumb
That way we will keep the public with us
At present my group cannot support your report
Mr President reforming the Council is probably the most difficult task of all
In practice it simply means calling on the Council to reform itself
So I am not surprised to find it was not even present to listen to this appeal and that it seems to be fairly indifferent to Parliament reform project
The Council is the Achilles heel of European democracy if not the black hole
That is because of its amphibious nature
As a European institution it is constantly distancing itself from the national parliaments and the national and European courts
It is constantly distancing itself from the European Parliament by presenting itself as a meeting of the Member States
That is why I do not have any real hope that this black hole of democracy can be closed that we will finally see open legislation majority decisions the democratisation of the second and third pillar
This kind of governmental cooperation is increasingly becoming a democratic no man land
I congratulate the rapporteur on his attempts to at least sketch out the broad lines of reform here
I also congratulate him on the clever way in which he proposed a revolutionary shift of power in favour of the large states while presenting this as maintaining the existing balance
That is a particularly successful intellectual proposal
Mr President the Bourlanges report subscribes to the view that the Council should become a second house representing the Member States and that the Commission should gradually develop into a genuine European executive
As I explained in the minority opinion attached to the report the I-EDN Group considers that such a development would be dangerous and that the Council must continue in its role as a central decision-maker representing the Member States and as the hierarchical superior of the Commission
In fact one of the lessons we should draw from the recent debates on the motion of censure against the Commission is that the European institutions which cover many countries are particularly at risk of becoming cut off from the people
This is especially true of the Commission which relies on a European civil service with fairly weak national links
The remedy must involve carefully strengthening the subordinating link by which Brussels serves the Member States
This link places the Council in a privileged position
This is why the individual voice of each Member State must be maintained in the Council by preserving unanimity and why every means must be used to strengthen the Council control over the Commission
On this essential issue the Bourlanges report is silent
Therefore the opportunity to solve one of Europe current major problems is being missed
In fact Europe is heading in the wrong direction towards a superstate cut off from the people
Mr President ladies and gentlemen I should like to begin by congratulating the rapporteur who in my opinion has presented us with a magnificent report that offers a forward-looking analysis of the institutions of an enlarged European Union and of issues that the Treaty of Amsterdam obviously failed to resolve
I think that his report strongest point is its defence of the Community method at a time when there are clear signs of a return to intergovernmental working in the European Union
I think especially that the rapporteur proposals on reorganising the Council business are a step in the right direction
Not only in terms of efficiency by extending qualified majority voting but also by restoring the institutional balance provided for in the Treaty where there has been a shift towards a greater executive and governmental role for the Council to the detriment of the Commission roles in taking initiatives and acting as a political driving-force which are recognised in the Treaty and which it should continue to play
That is why I cannot understand the rapporteur detailed proposals on the weighting of votes in the Council
It is obvious that the demographic weight of the different countries should be reflected in their voting power and that a minority of the population should not be able to prevail against the majority
That would be undemocratic and would be rightly rejected by public opinion in the larger countries
In my opinion however it is in Parliament with its legislative codecision rights that the different demographic weighting of the Member States should manifest itself we shall in any case soon have to change the current proportion of Members per country in view of enlargement and the plans for a smaller Parliament with Members
In the Council given its governmental role the original balance between small and large countries should be maintained
We should avoid giving the impression that we are setting up a directing board of large countries especially four months away from the elections and in the midst of all the anti-European propaganda that we have heard in today debate
One last remark on the content of paragraph I cannot accept this because it would give greater decision-making powers on the budget to the bigger contributors and is totally at odds with the Community method
Mr President the Bourlanges report is excellent as was only to be expected
For many years Jean-Louis Bourlanges has spearheaded the process of European integration
Looking at him though perhaps he is not quite as pointed as a spearhead
But the Bourlanges report is also an important one
For it reminds us in good time that the Union is constantly facing two tasks enlargement and deepening
We have spoken a great deal about enlargement over the past months
And we have repeatedly and rightly referred to the homework the applicant countries must do
Let me remind you for instance of the debate in this House prior to the Vienna summit
At the same time we must not forget to do our own homework here in this House and here in the Union
The European Union must remain able to act or to be more precise become more able to act
Amsterdam has brought some progress in this area but the opportunity for progress at the last minute was clearly not taken
In particular the important questions of decision-making in the Council have remained open
The Bourlanges report considers these questions and seeks constructive forward-looking solutions to them
By and large I believe it has done so with great success as many of the previous speakers have pointed out and emphasised
I believe there are still some question marks in regard to certain parts of the call however right in principle for the general introduction of majority voting in the Council
I am particularly sceptical about paragraphs and concerning own resources and qualified majority voting
Let me address a last point that was rightly raised in an amendment tabled by Mr Saint-Pierre
We must also consider the method of the next treaty reform and here it is the Community method that is the right one not the intergovernmental conference method which is governed only by the power of veto
Mr President this is a crucial time to be debating and voting on this report on the Council an excellent report incidentally
The European Union is currently at a complex and difficult stage It is going through a period of evolution and a lot of balances are being undermined
So it is becoming one of the European Parliament essential tasks to debate the institutions and the way they work
I am tempted to say that in the absence of real reform and with all the institutional balances fluid Parliament really must start thinking strategically about the development of the Union again
The Commission is being weakened That is a fact
I cannot say whether there is also a political attack going on against the Commission but it is certainly being weakened
The role of the European Council is developing in an anomalous way as the Bourlanges report rightly emphasises
Parliament and the Council should legislate in parallel but it cannot really be claimed that this is really what is happening
In essence the whole way the system operates is changing especially with the enlargement approaching and after the launch of the euro
The Bourlanges report confronts these issues head on with a free-ranging imaginative approach to the institutions
There has never been a greater need for imagination about the institutions inspired by a dynamic rather than a literal interpretation of the Treaty and of course as everyone knows dynamic interpretations sometimes go beyond the legislative text
There has never been a greater need to highlight the institutional hypocrisy of those who claim that an enlarged European Union can continue to function without reform of the institutions
There are many worthwhile ideas in the report but I am not going to highlight what is probably the central point namely the redefinition of the role of the General Affairs Council which Mr Bourlanges discusses
Instead I want to emphasise a point which in my opinion emerges from the interpretation of the report
I believe that attention should be focused on trying to restore the balance between the European Council and the Commission the two authorities driving policy and legislation
The future progress of the European Union will largely depend on this balance
This is a fundamental point
I think the balance is currently being undermined by both the anomalous development of the Council and the weakening of the Commission
To conclude Mr President I see this whole report as going beyond the old approach of intergovernmental versus supranational
Redefining the balance between the Council and the Commission marks the end of that approach
That is where I think Mr Bourlanges has made an extremely important contribution
Mr President I did prepare a speech but I have left it aside because many of my points have already been excellently made by previous speakers
I therefore see no need in repeating what has already been said
However I must mention two points
The first is that it has been a matter of regret for a long time and still is now that the Amsterdam Treaty did not go to its logical conclusion and effectively prepare for enlargement
The European Parliament must take some of the blame for this because it did not propose any solutions because of the fact that it was still divided
Now that this moment has arrived I welcome the fact that the Committee on Institutional Affairs and its rapporteur have dared to put forward a solution
I feel that the most important point is that our hands are no longer empty
There may be better solutions which must now be put forward but at least we have a solution to offer
My second point is that through the debates within the political groups between the small states and the large states a fundamental element of the future of Europe has become evident within the European structure each of us as individuals is part of a minority and each of the Member States is part of a minority
We must therefore heed each other and develop this minority culture which is the future of Europe
To conclude I believe that with a solution in one hand and a philosophy in the other this process has indeed begun and I welcome that fact
Mr President regarding the content of the report I would like to thank the rapporteur Mr Bourlanges for having supported the amendment we tabled
It is an amendment that will make it possible in the future for there to be formal Council of Ministers meetings involving the ministers responsible for women rights
It is an important amendment as it deals with a key problem in Europe today the traditional exclusion of women from the decision-making process
I hope that the PPE Group will also support this amendment and that the Commission which is represented here in this debate will be sensitive to this issue and support this move
At the moment the ministers responsible for women rights cannot meet in a formal Council of Ministers
I therefore believe that by providing for this possibility we are taking a major step forward in defending the necessary involvement of women in the decision-making process
Secondly and from a general point of view I believe that it is not only advisable but also necessary for us to reflect on such issues given that the European Union is currently initiating a large-scale process of enlargement
The report by Mr Bourlanges proposes undeniable improvements and I must say that in my view he also proposes the correct path to be followed in favouring a Community method that renders the traditional and until now prevalent intergovernmental method obsolete
It is truly shameful that the Council of Ministers is not represented here when Europe elected representatives are debating something that directly concerns both it and all Europeans
Mr President ladies and gentlemen I do not rightly understand the meaning of all this paperwork and its timetable
Perhaps it is obvious to some but to many of us it is not
There has been insufficient preparation for and discussion of this issue yet it is a very serious matter
Nevertheless I believe that an increase in qualified majority voting is appropriate if the work of the Union is to be more effective
The report contains some conflicting ideas however such as paragraphs and 
Paragraph states that Member States with small and medium-sized populations are over-represented and this system should thus be replaced with a reorganisation of the weighting of votes and a double majority
However paragraph says that the current balance must not be overturned
This seems to be in conflict with the previous paragraph
It is perhaps due to the fact that the rapporteur is actually only referring to the balance that exists among the states with large populations
At the time of the Amsterdam conference Finland put forward a preliminary proposal for a compromise whereby all Member State votes would double in number however the larger countries would get two or perhaps more extra votes in the process
This would also be an acceptable solution for small countries
Such a model would possibly be a less destabilising solution than the current weighting structure and would not be too much of an upheaval for the countries with small populations
The basic position here is that institutional reform will not succeed without also taking the share of the small countries into consideration when the number of votes is being weighted
Mr President ladies and gentlemen I would like to begin by thanking the Committee on Institutional Affairs and its rapporteurs for their various reports on specific issues related to the application of the Treaty of Amsterdam or on issues that we will have to tackle in the near future in order to achieve a more effective democratic and transparent institutional system
The report by Mr Bourlanges fits perfectly into this context and the vast majority of speakers clearly recognised this
I would also like to thank him for the educational way in which he presented his report outlining as he did its key aspects its objective in case we were in any doubt its scope its content and its focus
The report deals with an institutional problem that to my mind is essential in defining the future architecture of Europe and more specifically that of a Union that hopes to become the instrument that peacefully unites the continent
I am referring to the European Union decision-making process in the light of enlargement an issue that many speakers referred to
Our task is to devise and build an institutional system that must be based on three key principles in my opinion
The first is to ensure the continuity of a process and an institutional structure that has provided extraordinary results in terms of peace progress and democracy
The second is to adapt to a changing world that even as far as public institutions are concerned requires a high degree of flexibility
I agree with the idea put forward by Mr Izquierdo Rojo concerning formal meetings of the ministers responsible for women rights on issues that directly affect them and that must become a Community responsibility
This idea is very welcome and I have taken note of it
The third principle is to ensure that we can organise an entire continent around a single system that must aim to be politically and economically coherent
I therefore believe that we must initially look at the various aspects of our system with a view to reforming it and implementing the constitutional mechanism that Mr De Giovanni mentioned This mechanism is currently being discussed and is in need of clarification
I believe that we can ask ourselves a series of basic questions here
Is there confusion between the Council and its various formations as mentioned by Mr Brinkhorst and other speakers
Is there confusion between the institutions that have an executive role
This was mentioned by Mrs Cardona among others However I must admit that I totally disagree with the idea that the Commission should merely play an implementing role
It has another key function that of initiating legislation and we cannot forget that
Moreover can we talk about excessive bureaucracy in the preparations for the Council political decisions
Should it not improve its capacity for action as Mr Rack pointed out
The report seems to respond positively to these questions It also puts forward certain proposals that would undoubtedly improve the current situation
I entirely agree with the rapporteur opinion about the Council dual executive and legislative role
And in this respect I understand the comments made by Mr Saint-Pierre to the effect that the Council cannot merely be the sum of the national executives
In my opinion this dual role legislative and executive is only possible from an institutional point of view if we also have a strong Commission The Commission must be able to carry out its full role and exercise its right of initiative as well as monitoring the application of Community law and where possible its implementation
Without going into each of the specific proposals in the text I would say that Mr Bourlanges comments on the European Council should be given consideration
And in my view the European Council must clearly continue with its role of providing political momentum and direction for the entire Union
In this respect I also agree with the remark by Mr De Giovanni concerning the need to find a balance between the role of the European Council and that of the Commission
I recall that during the speech I made when I assumed responsibility for institutional issues someone asked me if I thought that the Commission should only have a relationship with Parliament and not with the European Council
I replied that both should be given consideration
As far as I am concerned there is to some extent a form of double legitimacy and it is therefore logical to have such a double relationship
I would now like to look at the issue raised by the rapporteur concerning the need to strengthen the legal aspects of the Council decision-making process including the decisions taken by the Heads of State and Government I must say to Mr Bourlanges that I have some doubts here
Moves in this direction would undoubtedly eventually weaken the noble role of the European Council as an institution that is the driving force behind our major political and strategic orientations It would risk becoming a body to which we referred even the most minor decisions as happened in the s
We must ensure that that situation is not repeated
I do not need to remind you of the dangers that situation brought with it
In short it is clear that we now need to strengthen our institutional system although it has already reached a certain degree of maturity since its institutions are increasingly subject to the democratic control of this Parliament Moreover we need to clarify the responsibilities of the national parliaments within the Community framework
There are two roles here the fundamental role of the European Parliament and the role of the national parliaments
As Mrs Schörling said we must do this in such a way so as to ensure that we know who does what
We therefore need greater clarification of the issues something that is often lacking
I also believe that it is of the utmost importance to do all we can to make the Council more coherent
This means that both from the point of view of the workings of its various formations and in terms of the participation of the governments we need to ensure that we can guarantee that its positions in the various bodies are consistent This is an issue that several speakers mentioned
There are other points in the resolution that are particularly important
Firstly I fully agree with the basic principle that the power of initiative should not lie with the Council
The Community system is based on the Commission monopoly of legislative initiative and this is a system that in general has worked well
Despite certain attacks on the Commission monopoly the negotiations during the last Intergovernmental Conference confirmed that this is not only to remain intact as far as the Commission is concerned but that in certain areas such as justice and home affairs the Commission will automatically gain the monopoly after five years
This principle is probably the most original feature of our institutional system and perhaps even its cornerstone We must certainly not relinquish it
As regards decision-making in the Council I am of course totally in favour of the extension of qualified majority voting
Most speakers referred to this issue although some were naturally opposed to it
I believe that the extension of qualified majority voting does not mean that there will not be certain exceptions
There must be exceptions that are very clearly defined specifically as regards what we could call constitutional decisions
The resolution considers these In my view they are only logical as there are clearly some fundamental decisions that have to be agreed on by all the Member States
However as Mr Corbett mentioned a moment ago the most important question is how will a Europe with or Member States be able to take decisions unanimously in certain areas
It is extremely urgent to give consideration to the weighting of votes to the composition of the Commission and to the extension of qualified majority voting
As you know these issues were not resolved at the last Intergovernmental Conference but we need to find solutions to them in order to comply with both the Protocol on the institutions in the Treaty of Amsterdam and the express wishes of the Member States
The report puts forward balanced proposals concerning the weighting of votes
However I noticed that some speakers such as Mr Corbett for example were rather reluctant about creating a double majority system
I have also noted the comments made by Mr Barros Moura in this respect
I would like to end by looking very briefly at two issues
Firstly I believe it is important to ensure that the framework for the common foreign and security policy set out in the Treaty of Amsterdam is applied as soon as possible and as willingly and effectively as possible However I have noted that some people are pessimistic in this respect
The second problem relates to transparency
The Treaty of Amsterdam requires additional efforts in this area on the part of the Union and its institutions
Each institution must therefore review its procedures and eliminate a whole series of prejudices concerning confidentiality and the secrecy of deliberations These are incompatible with legislative activity that requires deliberations to be made public
The Council needs to make significant efforts in this direction as the Court of Justice has pointed out in recent judgments
Transparency and the public trust in the institutions are an essential condition both for the very existence of the institutional system and to guarantee that it runs smoothly And this is particularly true in an enlarged Europe
We can adopt the reforms we want to but if we do so in secret meetings or if we give the public the impression that we want to hide the reasons behind our decisions we will come to realise that we are lacking the important democratic and public nature that all national democracies possess This is something that we need to bring to European democracy
I will thus end with three words democracy effectiveness and transparency
And as Mr Méndez de Vigo very wisely said we must concentrate on the future and provide courageous solutions
Thank you Commissioner
The debate is closed
The vote will take place tomorrow at am
Strengthening EU institutions
The next item is the report A by Mr Gutiérrez Díaz on behalf of the Committee on Institutional Affairs on strengthening EU institutions with a view to creating an area of democracy and freedom
Mr President Commissioner ladies and gentlemen this House is today considering the report on strengthening the Union institutions with a view to establishing an area of democracy and liberty This report is the result of the contributions from the Committee on Institutional Affairs and includes the valuable opinion by the Committee on Civil Liberties and Internal Affairs which Mr Goerens drafted
The initial consideration of this issue stemmed from the contributions by Mr Herzog whom I replaced as rapporteur
In replacing him I hoped to be able to complete the definitive version of the report we are considering today which takes account of the debates held and includes most of the amendments tabled by the Committee on Institutional Affairs designed to increase the involvement of the general public and social players in the operation of the European Union institutional system
The key aspect of the report is based on the belief that it will not be possible to construct a democratic Europe unless its citizens are recognised not only as being the direct beneficiaries of the integration process but also and perhaps fundamentally as subjects who actively help to formulate common objectives
Despite its inadequacies the Treaty of Amsterdam does offer us some new elements that strengthen the guarantees provided at European level for the respect of fundamental rights
It also reinforces the social dimension of European integration by coordinating national employment policies and incorporating the requisite legal bases for the formulation of European social legislation
Finally it enhances the free movement of persons
In our view this should all be brought together within an overall plan for a European area of freedom and democracy built on strong foundations
To construct such an area we will need to specify the common objectives of European society to upgrade the rights accorded to Europe citizens to reinforce the rights of minorities to determine the legal instruments for the implementation of such rights and to provide for citizens to participate in the creation and enrichment of this area
The report sets out three major objectives here freedom of movement social rights and European citizenship
As regards freedom of movement I would like to point out in particular that security and justice must be accompanied by the necessary democratic and judicial guarantees
As far as social rights are concerned the concept of European integration is based on solidarity between the Member States As a result enlargement to embrace the countries of Central and Eastern Europe should not be regarded as an extension of the internal market but as a duty imposed by the requirements of solidarity
As regards European citizenship I would like to highlight the final proposal in the report that calls for the Treaty to bring all the rights conferred on citizens within the ambit of a specific title
I believe that if we approve this report by a wide majority we will be contributing to the much-needed construction and reinforcement of an area of democracy and liberty within the Union
I would therefore urge you to vote in favour of this report
Finally allow me to thank those who tabled amendments to the report
As I mentioned I generally tried to incorporate them except in two cases when the amendments did not conform to the vision of European integration that I support or when they introduced points albeit legitimate ones regarding competitiveness which I felt did not belong in this report
I would therefore like to thank you all
Mr President we are indebted to Mr Gutiérrez Díaz for this excellent report As he has just said the area of freedom security and justice introduced by the Amsterdam Treaty represents the Union most ambitious forthcoming programme of integration
And because of the way it connects with daily life in families cities and businesses the programme is also arousing great public interest
Furthermore it establishes vital links between the roles of this Parliament and the national parliaments
I think this five year transition phase does involve Europe entire parliamentary system but during transition there must also be pressure to start applying the community method and the codecision procedure as soon as possible to a field as vital as this to integration
In a sense this programme has already begun to form part of our legislation and it is natural that it should become the focal point of the wider vision which inspires this report the establishment of a European area of political freedom and democracy
Encapsulating the catalogue of fundamental rights and social rights in a single vision and developing programmes for freedom security and justice is exactly the right way to set about promoting and actually achieving the concept of European citizenship introduced at Maastricht
Indeed this is the essential constitutional institution on which to build the very idea of a European public and political area an area where rights and duties all rights and duties with no special emphasis on any one are balanced in the European Union framework for inclusive democracy
Mr President that is why we should vote for this report
Mr President Commissioner ladies and gentlemen every citizen of the European Union should be entitled to live in an area of freedom and democracy
That is what the report is endeavouring to safeguard
There is a great deal in the report about social rights but rather less when it comes to establishing a legal base for them
Up to now we have held fast to the idea that in Europe citizens should enjoy the same rights as the citizens in the countries in which they work
At the beginning of paragraph however the rapporteur proposes that citizens should be provided with guarantees at European level equivalent to those provided at national level which in some cases would be absurd
Therefore we strongly support the indents calling for an improvement in cross-border coordination of civil legislation
We would also stress the need for the mutual recognition of judicial decisions
Observance of the Union pension provisions is abysmal
They should be made more effective so that citizens are granted pension rights irrespective of their place of residence or work
In that respect the rapporteur is right
However we should be wary of any change that would lead to the adoption of a rate based on the highest common denominator which would in turn lead to a very high level of taxation
It can be difficult to reconcile social legislation of this kind with the overall objectives for example stimulating employment reducing unemployment and enhancing the quality of life because of the different levels of development and economic progress that obtain in the various countries
Sometimes social rights that are appropriate in one country are inappropriate when translated into another country social and economic system which is based on a different set of priorities
Imposing social rights on others may lead to a hypothetical quality of life but in reality only serves to undermine the general well-being this is always so where the welfare system is financed through taxation
We should approach the problem from the other direction by ensuring that the Union has in place the right structures for strengthening competitiveness and providing a climate that is conducive to business development After all it is enterprises that will generate a better quality of life and as a result an improved social welfare system
The main aim of the report is to strengthen citizens rights and in particular to protect them against crime
It is essential for the Union to make progress in this respect particularly in view of future enlargement
In this context we have tabled an amendment on the incorporation of Schengen into the Treaty
Accordingly we should like to see an end to the Council tortuous decision-making process during the five-year period with regard to certain legislative issues
What is needed in that area is a clear and unambiguous taking of positions just as Mr Bourlanges has done in his exemplary and practical report
Mr President I should like to compliment Mr Gutiérrez Díaz on his report which covers a wide range of issues
Originally it did not quite do justice to the crux of the matter which is the strengthening of the institutions involved in the creation of an area of freedom security and justice
After the Amsterdam Treaty comes into force that will be one of the major achievements of the Intergovernmental Conference
These areas of asylum immigration and border controls are now going to be common policies
However this has come about at a cost
Member States have watered down the role and the competence of the European Union democratic and judicial institutions notably the European Parliament and the Court of Justice and also the decision-making procedures for a period of at least five years
This undermining of the Community must not create a precedent Rather it must be reversed
Against that background I tabled amendments and I should like to thank Mr Gutiérrez Díaz for accepting them
The key points are that the unanimity requirement stands in the way of efficient and rapid action in this field
Action in the field of freedom security and justice must be accompanied by the necessary democratic and judicial guarantees
The Council must start applying the Community methods in full
Ultimately the Treaty must also remedy the very bizarre position of the United Kingdom Denmark and Ireland which have opted out of the new policies although in fact a country like Denmark will apply the policies as they stand but on an intergovernmental basis
For the time being and this is a point I have always emphasised very strongly in this hemicycle there is the continuing failure to incorporate Schengen into the first pillar
We still do not have the final division between the first and the third pillar
Against this background the report has now developed these concepts and my group will vote for it
However I hope that we see it only as the beginning
We have only started the common area
The final development will take place in the coming years
Mr President first I would like to congratulate Mr Gutiérrez Díaz on an excellent report
Article of the Treaty of Amsterdam provides a legal basis for the action necessary to prevent discrimination on the basis of disability age or gender among others
How much weight Article will carry in the future very much depends in the long run on political will
Take the guidelines on employment for example
There was sufficient political will there and hopefully this will also be the case with Article 
I am happy to see that the Commission has embarked on preparatory measures as a result of Article 
I also hope that Germany as the current presidency and its successor my own country Finland will be active in the Council in exploiting the opportunities presented by Article 
Our citizens have considerable expectations
It is also important that the European Parliament has a major influence on what is contained in Article in practice
Mr President the gradual creation of an area of freedom security and justice has constantly been held up as one of the successes of the Amsterdam Treaty
This is logically linked to the idea of supporting the steps required to achieve freedom of movement with accompanying measures to respond to the citizens need for security following the opening up of the borders
The security summit it has just been decided to hold and which the Finnish Presidency has undertaken to organise is also a sign pointing in the right direction
So I regret the fact that the report we are debating today treats the subject of security in a rather summary manner and is reduced to a report on democracy and freedom rather than on security
As I find in my daily dealings with them our citizens take the subject of security very seriously
The Commissioner has also emphasised its importance
Of course it is important to take a visionary approach
But as the representative of the people the European Parliament would be well advised to attach greater importance to the citizens need for security and to focus particularly on looking after their interests within the institutional system
Mr President the Amsterdam Treaty is a good starting-point for achieving a more democratic and open EU with freedom of movement and more fundamental rights for our citizens and a stronger social dimension
I think there are many sensible things in this report
The new Treaty opens up a host of new possibilities but whether or not they are carried out in practice depends of course on the political will
There is no doubt that we in Parliament will have to exert pressure if it is to succeed
There is no other way
Some decisions still require unanimity and some countries including Denmark still have reservations about participating in supranational cooperation for example in the area of refugees and asylum
That is a decision taken after a referendum on the Maastricht Treaty and it should of course be respected until the people decide otherwise
I would like to stress that it is also part of democracy that people in nation states can form an opinion on these things on the basis of how they see them and that only the people themselves can change the decisions they have made
The rapporteur is very concerned about a multi-speed Europe meaning that countries opt out of some areas of cooperation or that a group of countries begin to cooperate more closely
I too can see that this danger exists but sometimes it is necessary not least when more countries join in cooperation to respect the fact that there may be different speeds within that cooperation
I also believe that we shall face such a dilemma in future when people have different ideas about what we should cooperate on but I agree with the rapporteur that a multi-speed Europe should naturally be a last resort
I think we should be aware that the pragmatic cooperation we need to have at the same time as our visions may also make it necessary for there to be different speeds
Mr President I welcome Mr Gutiérrez Díaz report
I have known the rapporteur a long time and I know him well
He has produced a very good report but there are a number of points I find it difficult to agree with
We must remember that Europe is an area of democracy
There are Member States with democratically elected governments
There are also numerous regional governments and local government
And that is all the democracy we require
We are in danger of going too far
I do not believe we need further levels of bureaucracy paid for by the European taxpayer
However there are areas where we could bring Parliament and indeed Europe closer to the people
I feel very strongly that anywhere there is a Commission office in the Union there should also be a Parliament office
This is necessary because the people of Europe can identify with the European Parliament more easily than with the faceless bureaucracy of the Commission
That has been proved in this Parliament in recent times
So where you have regional parliaments or assemblies Parliament should also have an office
That would go a long way to counteracting the remoteness of Brussels and the European Union
Mr President Commissioner ladies and gentlemen anyone who has been following the three reports of our three colleagues throughout the morning will be asking themselves what in fact was discussed at Amsterdam about issues such as EU institutions the democratic deficit transparency and the rights of European citizens The answer is a resounding nothing
Mr Gutiérrez Díaz is to be congratulated on his report in particular in respect of a proposal he makes to create a special charter for the rights of European citizens
However I have to say to those European citizens who are listening to us today in the public gallery that we turn our minds to them once every five years just before the elections
The Parliamentary groups in particular the two large groups the Socialists and the Christian Democrats present them with ideological manifestos which are utterly remote from reality and which bear no relation whatsoever to what they do and to their voting record over their five-year term of office
It is a great pity that the Council of Ministers appears to be too busy to come here and attend the debate today
And the citizens of Europe must know that there are just two institutions in the entire world which meet behind closed doors the National Assembly of China and the Council of Ministers of the European Union
How is it possible for this to go by the name of democracy and how is it possible that in the name of this democracy we call upon you to vote in the June elections
Mr President I wish to begin by complimenting Vice-President Gutiérrez Díaz on his interesting and thought-provoking report
If the Union and its institutions are to continue to develop and become stronger over the coming years it is vital that the citizens of each of our countries continue to accept the democratic legitimacy of these institutions
We are all citizens of democratic countries and as far as I am aware the vast majority of the citizens of each of our countries accepts the democratic nature of our national governments
However at European level serious questions continue to be raised by many of our citizens concerning democracy and the European institutions
It is important that the European institutions that are directly accountable to the electorate in other words Parliament and the Council of Ministers should continue to have and be seen to have the final decision-making authority on issues of importance to our citizens
It is equally important that the Commission as the institution charged with implementing European policies should have a reputation for efficient fair-minded and even-handed administration of European policies agreed on in Parliament and the Council
This could be best achieved by first ensuring that the interests and concerns of the citizens of each of our countries are made known at the highest level in the Commission
The present system whereby there is at least one Commissioner from each Member State has worked well in the past and should be maintained
Those who advocate the end of this guarantee of one Commissioner per Member State supposedly in the interests of efficiency risk the creation of a Commission which is remote from the citizens of our individual countries
This in turn would weaken the Commission as a European institution
In any event the basic structures of the Union which existed at the time individual countries joined the Union and which enjoyed the support of the majority of our electorate at that time should be preserved as far as possible
Foremost amongst these basic structures was and still is the principle that each country should have representation at decision-making level in all the major institutions
Finally the Council the Commission Parliament and the Court of Justice all have representatives from each Member State at present a fact which contributes significantly to the legitimacy which these institutions enjoy in each of our countries
Mr President ladies and gentlemen I would also like to congratulate Mr Gutiérrez Díaz and the Committee on Institutional Affairs on this excellent report
In my view the Treaty of Amsterdam is inadequate in some respects it has both good and bad points However it has allowed us to make significant progress in the area of citizenship although it is currently difficult to assess the full scope and implications of this
The Treaty provides us with the possibility of creating the largest ever area in which people can move and work without any obstacles with equality and with full respect for their rights and for the foundations of the rule of law
The Commission presented a communication in July on the creation of a European area of freedom security and justice
As you all know and as Mr Hager just pointed out during the informal meeting of the Heads of State and Government in Pörtschach a decision was made to hold a special Council meeting dedicated solely to issues relating to justice and home affairs in October of this year in Tampere in Finland
I fully understand your concerns over certain issues raised by the Treaty and in particular the question of how to establish the conditions required for its implementation
The Treaty of Amsterdam does not precisely define the objectives to be met by the institutions as Mr Kaklamanis pointed out
However this lack of precision is to a certain extent necessary since an area of liberty can never be fully consolidated
It can only exist if it is capable of constantly adapting to reality and of guaranteeing freedom and rights along with security and justice to all people in general and to its citizens in particular
The definition and implementation of these objectives require democratic participation which in the long term should come to mean full participation
Unfortunately as Mr Brinkhorst pointed out the Treaty specifies that a period of five years must pass before the Commission will have the monopoly of initiative in this area and before it can apply the codecision procedure in decision-making
Parliament must fully exercise its democratic control in this area by continuing to cooperate closely with the national parliaments This cooperation is something that Parliament has been building on and that will continue to develop
In this context we must make full use of the role of the Court of Justice in order to assert respect for the law as a condition for creating this area
One possibility here would be for the Court of Justice to sanction the actions of the institutions if they did not respect fundamental rights
There are limits to the jurisdiction of the Court in Luxembourg particularly as regards the second and third pillars but these must be progressively overcome
I agree with the rapporteur that it will not be possible to build an area of liberty unless we fully respect certain rights inherent in freedom of movement which are only partly respected at the moment
We must ensure that we adapt our rules to the reality of civil society
We have social standards that were perfectly adapted to the type of freedom of movement that existed or years ago but these might prove ineffective in the future
Equally the restrictions demanded by the Member States in days gone by may seem unjustified today
We need to create an area of liberty like that so skilfully described by Mr Manzella
In addition we need to realise that we will only have achieved complete democracy when European citizenship is fully consolidated in that area and fully accepted in our daily lives
I believe that the key here is to go back to the heart of the process of European integration as it was conceived in the s
We need to get rid of the feelings of hostility and rejection or even the idea that a European from a neighbouring country is a foreigner and we must replace them with the firm belief that the process of integration is above all a process of solidarity
I would also like to say that I am convinced that if these principles had formed the starting point for the actions of the Member States our institutional system would have been able to adapt much more quickly to citizens needs I therefore fully agree with the opinion expressed by the rapporteur Mr Gutiérrez Díaz in this respect
Moreover if these principles were truly followed the intergovernmental conferences would concentrate more on the common interest and be able to take some of the drama out of negotiations that are so important for the continuation of the process of European integration
At the same time we would move towards a Union that is more closely linked that has a greater sense of solidarity and that is more in tune with the concerns and needs of its citizens
Thank you Commissioner

OCTs ACP countries and remote regions
The next item is the report A by Mr Aldo on behalf of the Committee on Development and Cooperation on relations between the Overseas Countries and Territories OCTs the ACP States and the ultraperipheral regions UPRs of the European Union
Mr President ladies and gentlemen the own-initiative report on which the House is to vote is of fundamental importance for the future of the people of overseas Europe which since the Treaty of Rome of have all had different relations to varying degrees with the European Union
The report highlights the structural economic and social problems brought about by the relations that the European Union currently has with its remote territories relations that are not very well adapted However before looking at the report itself I would like in particular to express my sincere and heartfelt thanks to all those who contributed in any way to the drafting of this report
In order to ensure that this subject is properly understood and to avoid any misunderstandings I would also like to briefly explain the origins of this report and the motivation behind it
This was particularly evident in the confusion that existed between the overseas departments and the OCTs until the Hansen ruling that was handed down by the Court of Justice in I was also struck by the lack of consideration for the overseas dimension these regions bring to the Union as well as the failure to take account of their specific characteristics when applying Community law
For the OCTs there are anachronistic association arrangements which have their origins in the Treaty of Rome of and which ignore the fact that the vast majority of these countries have achieved sovereignty The OCTs and the ACP countries are constantly lumped together funding is not adapted to the institutional reality of the OCTs with their respective capitals and there is a total lack of partnership and consultation when applying Community law to the OCTs
As I come from an ultraperipheral region of the Union I therefore quite naturally set myself the objective of clarifying this issue and removing all those ambiguities and confusions that have tarnished the European Union relations with its various peripheral partners for almost half a century In this respect I had the unconditional support and encouragement of my political group and of other Members with an interest in the matter
Therefore in February I invited my political group to visit Guadeloupe in order to see for themselves the reality of the problems that I have just set out through study days on the European Union relations with the overseas departments
As a result on February in the presence of political and socio-professional leaders from the West Indies Guyana and the overseas territories along with members of the press I proposed for the first time that Article of the Treaty of Rome should be revised
Once the French Overseas Minister had taken over and following various processes and stages of consultation this led to the establishment of the new Article of the Treaty of Amsterdam
The aim of this approach was similar to that of the provisions of Article of the French Constitution of and then of It hoped to move the utlraperipheral regions towards an adapted integration removing their status of legal egalitarianism through a simplified interpretation of the law that applies to them
It was from this same perspective that in I fought for and obtained a more generalised debate on the European Union relations with the UPRs the OCTs and the ACP countries
As a result of this on October I requested as coordinator that this issue be included on the list of proposals to be the subject of a future parliamentary own-initiative report in the Committee on Development and Cooperation
I was successful in this respect so with this in mind and in order to move this issue forward while respecting the European Parliaments Rules of Procedure on January I sent a letter to Mr Michel Rocard who had recently been appointed as chairman of the Committee on Development and Cooperation I asked him to include this issue in the committee agenda to discuss the matter of the own-initiative report
Therefore following a vote at its meeting of Wednesday February the Committee on Development agreed to an own-initiative report on this issue and requested authorisation from the Presidency to draw up the report
That authorisation was granted by the Presidency at the beginning of July 
As a result I have the great honour and the very great pleasure of presenting to you today this own-initiative report that summarises the European Union vertical relations with its overseas partners but also attempts to summarise the horizontal relations between these different entities
We consider the UPRs to be outposts of the Union in various parts of the globe They are therefore showcases and the key players in Community action in their respective environments
The UPRs must play a leading role in Lomé and must be the driving force behind interregional cooperation
As far as the OCTs are concerned we now need to clarify their legal status especially by doing away with the analogy that is drawn with the ACP countries and all the ambiguities surrounding the system of rights to citizenship and rights of establishment
The hybrid regime for the OCTs which is somewhere between integration and cooperation must in no way be a collection of negative elements aimed at curbing through lack of knowledge or understanding the good and intelligent relations that must exist between the European Union and the overseas countries and territories
The association arrangements must therefore be reviewed as the original dual nature of their institutions with autonomy in terms of their national law and their justice system under Community law means that the OCT Declaration must give priority to four lines of reform These include strengthening the human dimension strengthening the partnership between the political leaders of the OCTs and the European Union strengthening financial solidarity by setting up a special development fund for the OCTs that would replace the current EDF and respecting the specific institutional features of each OCT
In our approach we must make every effort to preserve the powers devolved to the OCTs through their autonomous status
Mr President ladies and gentlemen my voice in this Hemicycle here today is nothing more than a reflection of the combined expectations of the elected representatives and the people of the overseas territories To assure myself that the views of the people were the same as mine I have made every effort to consult the people since I first began to consider this issue firstly as a regional councillor a member of the COPM since then as a founder member of the Committee of the Regions in and finally as a Member of this Parliament since 
There have obviously been others before me who have had the opportunity and the honour of speaking for the overseas departments notably through the Ligios report
It was that report that in report initially raised awareness in the Community institutions of the problems of the overseas departments and ultraperipheral regions and their specific characteristics and I would also like to thank and congratulate those people for their work
Applause
Mr President the Committee on Regional Policy was consulted on the excellent own-initiative report by our colleague Mr Aldo and considered the issue of relations between what are known as the ultraperipheral regions and the OCTs or ACP countries close to those ultraperipheral regions
This is the case for the Caribbean and the Indian Ocean
The Committee on Regional Policy unanimously decided that here we have countries that are united by geography history culture and often by language but that completely ignore each other from an economic point of view
Moreover there are complaints about how confined the markets are in the ultraperipheral regions
In reality we feel that it is absolutely necessary that these neighbouring countries which are naturally close should form real regional markets with a view to achieving sustainable and balanced development
The European Union must contribute to this by promoting joint ventures that is associations between companies from ultraperipheral regions and from neighbouring ACP countries and OCTs in order to develop these regional markets and their exports to the Union or to third countries
The Union will also have to include the ultraperipheral regions the OCTs and the ACP countries in the negotiations that will lead to the future Lomé conventions
These conventions must of course promote the establishment of the regional markets by doing away with the customs barriers In our view these barriers are like the leftovers from traditional colonial agreements and I would like to draw our colleagues attention to this
Economic exchanges between these countries must be guaranteed so as to encourage them to develop in a harmonious manner And once again there needs to be better understanding between neighbouring countries that are in such close proximity
Mr President the Committee on Fisheries welcomes Mr Aldo initiative It has the advantage of drawing attention to the perverse effects of the diversity of Community action concerning territories that are close in geographical terms but which have a different status
We need to avoid a situation whereby membership of the Union means that a territory is subject to a series of ill-adapted constraints and whereby non-membership means that a territory benefits from aid that promotes extra-Community competition to the detriment of our own territories
The socio-economic balance of all these territories is largely linked to activities that depend on the sea particularly fishing
Therefore our committee unanimously adopted a series of recommendations which were all taken over by the rapporteur They are aimed precisely at preventing a situation whereby membership of the European Union is a handicap for our ultraperipheral territories
Our committee highlights the need for changes in the law to allow the CFP to be applied differently in these regions that are very remote from the European continent
It must be adapted to the opportunities for development offered by their maritime areas that have a strong fisheries potential We also emphasise the need to improve equipment in particular by regionalising the MAGPs
Moreover we would stress the need to introduce a modulation of the POSEIDOM aid scheme as although its effectiveness has been proved certain provisions need to be refined in order to ensure better protection of resources
Our committee recommends that Community policies for the OCTs should be consistent with the European Union cooperation policies for the ACP countries particularly as regards preferential trade measures and policies on direct aid They should also be consistent with the GSP measures especially the drug GSP and we should reconsider the validity of this mechanism
Finally our committee underlines the urgent need for delimitation of waters in the Caribbean as that is the only means of achieving fisheries agreements in that region It also calls for stricter checks in Community waters dependent on the OCTs and ultraperipheral regions as these waters are frequented by many fleets from third countries that are drawing on the resources in an anarchic manner
We shall suspend the debate on the Aldo report at this point it will be resumed in the afternoon
We have now reached voting time

Madam President I would like to speak on a point of order pursuant to Rule 
Like all my colleagues who were present in the House this morning I noted with astonishment the Council absence during the debate on the Bourlanges report on decision-making within the Council in an enlarged Europe
Under Rule the Council may be present in the Chamber
As this is a debate on the reforms which must be undertaken in future in the context of the process of major institutional reform which Parliament is firmly demanding and which is at last gaining widespread support we feel it is imperative that the Council should attend
It may not be required to do so by any rules as such but it is surely only proper for it to do so
Whatever our opinions we all agree on the importance of this debate and of the ideas it allows us to develop prior to enlargement
I would ask the President to protest strongly to the Council on Parliament behalf at its absence during this morning debate
Applause
I can assure you that I will pass on your request Mr Duhamel since this is indeed a very unfortunate absence
Madam President we are now going to vote on Amendment No 
There is a technical problem here because I believe it would be a good idea to replace the first part of the original version of recital D with the first part of this amendment
I therefore propose a vote in two parts the first part up to victims of gender-specific persecution
But if the second part of the amendment is not adopted I would ask that we should vote on the second part of the original version of the recital
Otherwise this would not make sense
Madam President paragraph poses a linguistic problem in the French language version
Mrs Pailler put forward an amendment in committee and I pointed out to her that the term statut de non-droit was contradictory
We therefore changed it with her agreement
However I see today that it is still included in the French version
You must tell me which text is authentic and if it is the French text this expression must be changed once again
Yes it is the French version which is authentic
I propose that we insert situation de non-droit in the French version to replace statut de non-droit 
This is also the term that was adopted in committee
Parliament adopted the resolution
I am voting against this position because I believe it does not adequately address the technical issues involved
I intend to vote against the proposed draft Council regulation because I believe that the technical details have not been properly or fully investigated
There is need for a full review of the technical standards to ensure that safety standards are fully met whilst at the same time aircraft that are satisfactorily functioning from every point of view are not lost to our fleets
Gahrton report A
A civil peace corps is an old green idea for channelling European foreign policy cooperation in a constructive rather than a military and therefore destructive direction
The European Civil Peace Corps will be able to call on a core of full-time employed professionals as well as a pool of mission-specific professionals including conscientious objectors on a voluntary basis and unpaid volunteers for specific missions
It often happens that conflicts flare up again in the wake of a military peacekeeping mission because the causes of the violence have not been addressed
Facilitating dialogue and mutual confidence building should be a part of every peace mission
A lasting peace can be achieved above all through a genuine process of reconciliation
It is in that context that a civil peace corps should be able to fill a gap
I am fully aware that many of those who voted for this proposal believe that a civil peace corps should be complementary to the Union military capability
However the Green Group including myself clearly hope that it will become an alternative
We have absolutely nothing against the EU taking part in operations abroad provided that the activities are peaceful and constructive
Perhaps a successful civil peace corps might persuade some European activists that it is unfashionable and outdated to earn respect on the world stage through a show of military might
The future belongs to those who promote peace not war
This is a very important and much needed initiative
It is imperative that a peace corps of this type should be an entirely civil undertaking
The main task of the peace corps should be to reduce tension and prevent conflicts from escalating it should operate under a mandate of the United Nations or the OSCE and its primary purpose should be conflict prevention
In my view concrete examples of the tasks to be performed by a civil peace corps are as follows mediation and confidence building humanitarian assistance the disarmament and demobilisation of former combatants supporting refugees rehabilitation and reconstruction and the stabilisation of economic structures
Other tasks might include monitoring and improving human rights situations empowerment for political participation as well as interim administration to facilitate short-term stability
A civil peace corps might also extend its remit to providing information and establishing educational structures and programmes designed to eliminate prejudice and hostile images
An essential condition for achieving a peaceful outcome is involving both parties to the conflict in common projects
What is required is a core of full-time employed professionals backed up by a pool of experienced men and women to be called on for specific missions
In particular their professional expertise as peacekeepers conflict-solvers psychologists and so on should be exploited to the full
Read report A
Through an active and very skilful effort by Parliament delegation to the Conciliation Committee Parliament has succeeded in having most of its wishes from the first and second readings put into effect
For me it has been crucial throughout the procedure for the adoption of this extremely important directive to ensure that transmission and receiving equipment built by radio amateurs for their own use should not come under the directive rules on manufacturer self-testing and declarations of conformity
Barzanti report A
I wish to thank the rapporteur for his work on the EU Copyright Directive which is a complex and technical subject of importance to artists in Europe
The Greens have sought from the beginning to make the protection of the creativity of writers composers musicians-performers EU-wide a priority in amending the Copyright Directive
In Ireland musicians and performing artists such as BoyZone and the Corrs have appealed for copyright protection for their work
The rapporteur has my full support in his appeal for a strong directive protecting the music industry from piracy on the Internet
The fact is that digital technology can clone an exact reproduction of the original leading to an increased risk of piracy on the Internet
I will continue to support a call for a strong Copyright Directive
I am personally committed to the protection of the rights of European artists writers and composers
Europe cultural industries have a great deal to lose if this new directive is not absolutely protective of creative rights and intellectual property
We share the rapporteur view that harmonisation is needed to create a fully functioning internal market for those with copyright protection
However we cannot agree with Amendment No since it would mean that anyone wishing to set up a broadcasting organisation would be required to have a licence
In Sweden we have an effective system based on a licensing agreement In practical terms it consists of a collective agreement concluded by a representative licensing body
We would also like to emphasise that in our view the Member States should provide for exemptions from the copyright restrictions specified in Articles and in the case of non-commercial use for the benefit of people with disabilities
This is best expressed in Amendment No 
We would point out that in our view there should be exemption from the restrictions in Articles and for use where the purpose is to make official documents accessible to the public as set out in Amendment No 
We support the amendments granting exemption from the restrictions in Articles and in respect of the setting-up of a library or archive for example
At the end of the Commission put forward a controversial proposal for the harmonisation of copyright law in the Community
It did not believe that national laws were working well or had kept up with technological developments
The Commission also wished to limit the extensive pirate copying of CDs and CD-ROMs
In its original form the proposal meant that a consumer who had bought a CD could not copy it on to tape in order to be able to listen to the music while he was out jogging
Furthermore the Commission original proposal for a directive ignored the fact that a number of public service stations would have problems if they wished to use CDs as background music for TV broadcasts and that the visually impaired and people with reading difficulties would not be able to enjoy special offers from libraries
Special offers made available by public institutions to the handicapped will not be affected by the proposal
In the light of this the Danish Social Democrats have endorsed an amendment which ensures that special national schemes will not conflict with EU law
In this way it has been possible to secure a well-balanced copyright law which both safeguards the rights of producers to their own output and protects the interests of TV and radio stations and consumers
At the first reading of Mr Barzanti report today we have abstained from voting on the report as a whole
We are very concerned that the harmonisation of copyright law in the EU will obstruct free access to information for all social groups especially people with a visual handicap for example
The June Movement regards free access to information as the very cornerstone of democracy
Without opportunities for individual citizens to obtain knowledge and information the democratic process would become confused
Nonetheless we would have liked to support the report in order to protect the interests of artists and safeguard their rights in connection with the exploitation of their work
Because most of the amendments which we had hoped would safeguard the rights of artists were not adopted and since most of those which we had either tabled ourselves or endorsed and which would have ensured free access to information for the handicapped and others were also rejected we chose to abstain on the report as a whole
We will take the matter up again at second reading
Issues related to the information society and the Internet are of great interest to me
Apart from the aspects which imply a radical change in the way our societies are organised there are still a number of questions about how our legislation and our legal tools are going to have to change in future in this area
I would therefore like to congratulate our President José Maria Gil Robles and Roberto Barzanti for having responded so rapidly to artists concerns that their work is too often being used illegally on the Internet
While it is relatively easy to draw up a report and protecting the concept of copyright is the least we can do it is not easy to legislate at European level to provide proper protection for the victims of this plagiarism
This is an area where we need to show imagination in establishing effective legal protection
To do this I believe we must promote measures which are appropriate for the different forms of dissemination and piracy
Following the example of existing broadcasting legislation should we not also introduce a user charge levied when compression tools such as or are sold
However we have to be realistic since we have to find common ground with all parties concerned and in particular with the United States and the producers of this type of software
Therefore while I agree on the whole with the rapporteur concerns I question the distinction that is made between analogue copying and digital copying
In my opinion digital has already won
The Barzanti report stems from an important debate concerning the harmonisation of certain aspects of copyright and related rights in the information society
We believe that the report creates a good basis for further discussion of the protection and exercise of the privileges of rightholders
If we cannot endorse the report it is not because we wish to remove the advantages enjoyed by rightholders with regard to the exploitation of their work but because the proposal adopts an unnecessarily restrictive approach to the definition of rights which in the worst case would deny artists the right to negotiate for themselves both the scale of payment and what rights they transfer to a producer
The Scandinavian countries have a long tradition and great experience of solving difficult copyright issues with the help of licensing agreements
We think that this traditional Scandinavian model involving collective agreements ought to be retained
At the same time we take the view that publicly funded institutions which are open to the public such as museums libraries archives and so on should have the opportunity to participate fully in the development of the information society
Taken to the extreme the contents of the report would mean that copyright legislation would prevent them from fulfilling their non-commercial educational function
If the report is adopted in its current form without taking into account a number of proposed amendments it will for example no longer be possible to record radio and TV broadcasts for short-term use for the inmates of care homes hospitals prisons and so on
We believe that a move in this direction which does not sufficiently take account of the general public need for and right to free and equal access to information would be disastrous in terms of social development and democracy
Technological changes are currently weakening certain legal categories
This is true of the field of taxation where the Internet is changing basic concepts such as the tax frontier tax territory and the tax base
It is also true of the field of artistic and literary property
Two principles are in conflict here the right of the author to protect his work and his right to a fair income from his work versus the freedom of the Internet
In this respect the European Union is all the more contradictory as one of its fundamental principles is precisely that of free movement
However where there is freedom of movement there cannot be protection and vice versa
In literary and artistic works the Europe of Brussels is finally discovering what it has spent years refusing to see with coal steel textiles cars and agricultural products namely that freedom of movement prevents real protection
We want to give the field of culture what we have denied our farmers by reducing customs duties and the common agricultural levy and we wish to do so by means of an exception
This is good but it must be applied across the board
In itself the draft directive that we have been looking at includes entirely acceptable elements which are designed to protect authors ethical and financial rights
If we take music for example there is no doubt that digital compression technologies such as or the new VQF standard that has appeared recently represent a potential danger to the record industry even if no scientific study has as yet been undertaken to confirm this
In France we have seen only a slight drop in the sale of singles but this may be a mere coincidence
Another danger that is equally real lies in the solutions that might be introduced
It would be tempting to place the information society under supervision then we could control everything
The European Union makes no secret of its ambitions for the Internet to transform this information area this tool of cultural and personal development into a mere shopping arcade
In France we have seen the success of Canal+ where a broadcasting monopoly was effectively created
But nobody pointed out that Canal+ developed without any competition
In France the state has a monopoly on broadcasting
By penalising the pirating of Canal+ decoders we effectively created a monopoly on reception
And some people would like to do the same with the Internet the best of all possible worlds
The solution is not only to be found in a directive inevitably restricted to the European Union
Taking into account the level of market penetration it is above all American authors who are protected
European authors on the other hand do not have the same sort of guarantee as in the United States for example
The concept of copyright is much more restrictive there than in France for example
In order to effectively protect copyright and related rights a better solution would be an international conference on the subject where sovereign states could defend their own industries and agree to protect other countries in accordance with the principle of reciprocity
A balance must be struck between freedom and ownership
For the first time in history freedom is being played against art
This is a novelty for the artists
They had been taught by the Left to be defenders of freedom
Today they are pleading against it for the sake of their right to ownership
The Internet really is changing everything even the most firmly entrenched roles
The Community has certainly taken its time in getting round to harmonising the legal framework for copyright
In the last few years we have seen open and flexible legislation designed for an increasingly developed world of technology and computers on the one hand and on the other old and outdated rules as in Italy where the matter is governed by a law going back years
While there is absolutely no question of challenging the sacrosanct right of authors and editors to have their work protected we think it is crucial in regulating individual Member States exceptions to the right of reproduction not to dance to the tune of large record multinationals for example to the detriment of small and medium-sized European recording companies
Article needs rewording to avoid de facto restriction of access to the network for independent operators
There still needs to be a right of reproduction for scientific and cultural works which are educational rather than commercial together with a flat rate payment if more than % of the book is reproduced
This would also make things easier for small craft companies involved in reproduction and indeed for their clients almost always university students forced to buy very expensive textbooks even when they only need one chapter thus feeding an often unregulated lobbyist market obviously speculating on comparative prices
Until standard criteria which meet the needs of the market are finally established at Community level there is a risk that Member States may embark on different and even divergent paths seriously prejudicing the much-trumpeted achievement of the single market
I was sorry to have to abstain from the final vote on the Barzanti report
Adopting the text for Article as proposed by the rapporteur and approved by the Committee on Legal Affairs means that quite unjustified authorisations will be required for making technical copies from the Internet which will simply have the effect of extending the supremacy in distribution of the great American recording multinationals into the digital world
This is an extremely restrictive measure for European operators in clear and paradoxical contradiction to the Digital Millennium Copyright Act just promulgated in the United States
In other words two different legal frameworks are being constructed as regards Internet accessibility
In the United States operators freedom of access is recognised while in the European Union under pressure from the large multinationals and with the pretext of combatting piracy the scope which authors and independent groups have to express themselves is being reduced
As the procedure provides for a second reading considerable efforts are needed to promote an approach that gives greater weight to the legitimate principles of expression and right of access for European operators who are excluded today
At a time when incredibly rapid development is taking place in the area of digital technology we have found that earlier legislation in the field of copyright does not cover this area adequately
In dealing with this directive the Conservative Members of Parliament are working to create a balance between protecting the rights of copyright holders who are threatened by digital developments and safeguarding access to information for individual consumers especially in connection with television and radio
For me it is crucial that this balance is secured in the best way possible so that in future copyright holders will be assured of payment for the use of their work without severely limiting the range of information available to ordinary citizens
The creators of intellectual works and all those who have contributed to their creation are now virtually defenceless against the use distribution and reproduction of their work by means of new reproduction and communication technologies
National laws to protect intellectual property and associated rights together with the corresponding Community legislation which was inadequate even before globalisation and the implementation of digital technologies need reforming and supplementing immediately on the basis of the new technological facts
It is also crucial that measures be taken at national community and international level to protect authors and composers from piracy and from the theft use and reproduction of their work We believe that there has already been a considerable delay in implementing such measures
Notwithstanding certain objections and reservations we may have the report of the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens Rights is a positive attempt to tackle this problem
It also calls for already existing Community legislation to be brought up to date by providing legal protection in areas such as reproduction rights public broadcasting rights and distribution rights and by providing legal protection against piracy
Extending such protection to cover not only authors composers and performers but also producers of CDs and CD-ROMs and radio stations while positive and logical in principle must be examined to determine whether all these rights can be regarded as the same
Perhaps it would be better to examine such protection separately to avoid the danger of misinterpreting the term intellectual creation and the definition of composers and performers
Finally the most important and perhaps the most intractable problem is that of the distribution of artistic works and more generally intellectual property via the Internet and the possibility of reproducing such works using digital technology
Although the report attempts to tackle this problem we feel that it can only be solved if we address the more general issue of electronic copying especially at an international level and if we combat the new forms of piracy and forgery which are springing up and going unpunished
The Green Group in the European Parliament welcomes the draft directive aimed at revising the protection of copyright and related rights by harmonising it on a Union-wide basis so that it can meet the requirements of digital electronic communication
It takes account both of the user need for access and of the market conditions for the media suppliers and for the producers of the required technologies
We endorse the rapporteur endeavour to define the directive more precisely by giving precedence to copyright as the main concept
That decision was justified not only by the subject matter of the directive
Authors rights are the weakest in terms of the requirement of market and industrial freedom and therefore most in need of protection given that they relate to works that can only be treated as products to a limited extent
Consumer and producer protection have their place within this primary aim in that the consumer receives free access to the desired transmission of a work while at the same time the rightholder obtains fair compensation and the producer receives full protection against piracy
We welcome the fact that the Commission has largely incorporated Parliament position and therefore very much regret that it has rejected Amendment No in the form of a new recital which deals with the treatment of cultural works not protected by copyright as not relevant to the subject of the directive
Pérez Royo report A
The Swedish Social Democrats are delighted that steps are being taken to put an end to unfair tax competition between countries both outside and inside the European Union
However we are not sure that the Commission in its proposal is going the right way about it
In our view the fairest way would be for citizens to pay tax where they reside
Accordingly we wholeheartedly support the idea of an exchange of information between states rather than a model based on a minimum rate of taxation
Prior to the present proposal we would have preferred to be able to adopt a position on an exchange of information as opposed to a minimum tax rate
Now that this is not possible we have decided to support the amendment that advocates the highest minimum rate of tax
The Danish Social Democrats in the European Parliament are voting in favour of the EU setting rules on the minimum taxation of interest income from savings
Until now people have been able to avoid paying tax on savings deposited in other countries
This has led to unreasonable incomes and distortions in the market and has favoured banks in Luxembourg for example
The European Parliament has just approved a twin-track approach which means that a minimum percentage of interest income will either be withheld in the individual Member State or that banks and authorities will exchange information across borders so that tax can be collected
Banking secrecy could therefore be maintained if the first option is used
The Danish Social Democrats do not see the proposal in any way as a move towards tax harmonisation but as convincing evidence that the EU can put a stop to the extensive tax speculation in Europe
The proposal for a Council directive that we are examining today is one of the most important on which we have had to give our opinion in recent years
We all acknowledge that a guaranteed minimum effective taxation of savings income in the form of interest payments in EU Member States other than the investor country of residence is an ideal way to prevent harmful tax competition between the Member States
Apart from helping to reduce the distortions that are still widespread in the internal market this widening of the tax base will allow Member States if they so wish to reduce the excessive costs that burden labour income and sometimes seriously handicap our businesses subject as they are to international competition in an increasingly global economy
The proposal for a directive that we are discussing today is certainly not the last word in capital taxation regimes
On this point I agree entirely with the rapporteur that a great deal remains to be done in order to achieve an ideal capital taxation system and in particular that we need the broadest possible discussions on the issue with the EU major partners in the capital markets the US Japan and Switzerland
While we are working on such an agreement I like many others believe that this proposal for a directive is certainly an important step in the right direction
I would even say that it is the progress we have been waiting for for a number of years
The Commission has certainly done some excellent work here
I will therefore be supporting without any reservation whatsoever the proposal for a directive as amended by Parliament
I am delighted with the amendments introduced by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy to the proposal for a directive on taxation of savings which aims to ensure a minimum of effective taxation of individuals savings income in the form of interest payments within the Community
I am particularly delighted that my amendment to reduce the level of withholding tax from % to % has been adopted for three reasons
Firstly too high a rate would harm investment and therefore also growth and employment
Secondly the rate of withholding tax applied in international tax agreements only rarely exceeds %
Thirdly too high a rate would make all attempts to limit capital flight completely futile
The aim of the directive is to prevent capital flight to EU Member States where rates are higher
So how can we prevent capital from seeking out more favourable tax environments
From this perspective choosing a rate of % as suggested by the French Government would be an economic error that would run counter to the objective of fighting harmful tax competition
In this respect I am delighted with the proposal by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy to begin negotiations with neighbouring countries on fiscal matters
It has also been suggested that these discussions could then be extended to include the OECD members
This being the case it is good that the European Union is not making the outcome of these discussions a precondition for implementing the directive on taxation of savings
There are enough stumbling blocks already without adding others
I will therefore vote in favour of the resolution and the proposal for a directive provided that no amendment is adopted to modify my proposal for a withholding tax of %
As the House approves the % and does not deem it necessary to first reach an agreement with our neighbouring countries I am voting against the report
Tax policy is for the most part a national matter
However dumping through unfair tax competition where the aim is to avoid paying tax should be tackled by means of European rules provided minimum rules are applied
I have therefore voted in favour of the report
I voted against the Pérez Royo report on taxation of savings because it is the best way to ensure that savings leave the European Union
New York and Zurich which are already rubbing their hands will be the main beneficiaries of this suicidal relocation operation Zurich in particular when it comes to European collective investment undertakings within the meaning of the directive
To top it all it is only the collective investment undertakings that are targeted with the result that the promoters will try to relocate outside the EU in order to continue to sell collective investment undertakings to their European customers tax-free
This will mean the end of many of the European collective investment undertakings
You will have promoted tax evasion outside the Community and internal tax revenue will be non-existent
The Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy has turned a deaf ear
None of my amendments were adopted and my arguments against the ridiculous administrative burden proposed were not heeded
This enormously expensive red-tape for the paying agents will in itself create competitive disadvantages in terms of management costs and will result in collective investment undertakings leaving the EU
The Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy like Mr Monti is also turning a deaf ear to the need at the same time to take measures equivalent to those adopted in a Community directive in third countries that are likely to attract EU capital
If the directive was introduced it should apply above all to the dependent or associated territories of certain Member States and also where these Member States have particular responsibilities or tax prerogatives
The real tax havens within the Community are Monaco San Marino Andorra the Channel Islands the Netherlands Antilles and so on
Surely you do not believe that as Mr Poos the Luxembourg Minister has just stated in our Chamber of Deputies my country is prepared to agree to a fool bargain and to be the only one to play the unenviable role of the sacrificial lamb on the altar of rigged tax harmonisation
Moreover do not forget that there can be no question of abandoning our condition that the fiscal package put together on December under the Luxembourg Presidency should apply across the board
Long live unanimity
This is a classic example of tax harmonisation
First there was harmonisation of VAT and excise duties
Since then the European Commission has been dragging out its plans to harmonise corporate tax and above all to harmonise taxation of savings especially as the single currency has heightened the distortions between many tax systems with all the risks of relocation and competition between them
Being a poor loser the Commission has tried to guard against the fiscal dumping that is inherent in free movement by means of its European Code of Conduct which is in fact only a cartelisation code for tax authorities in order to maintain the oligopoly
It is against this background that we have the Pérez Royo report on the proposal for a directive of June which clearly aims to set a ceiling on taxation of savings income in order to counter the Luxembourg tax haven
There would be a dual ceiling either the application of a % rate of taxation on interest payments or the supply of information
Taxation or information
The choice would be between paying the withholding tax and being subject to taxation in the Member State of residence
This is what we call the model of coexistence the coexistence of states that apply the withholding tax regime and states that do not
But that does not solve the problem of globalisation
Capital moves around even beyond Europe
The problem exists for Eurobonds which may be underwritten by investors outside Europe
Hence the proposal from Professor Pérez Royo for a multilateral agreement with Japan Switzerland and the US
This shows how outdated Europe is the tax village is becoming global
In terms of capital globalisation is complete
European taxation is therefore obsolete
It can only apply to taxpayers whose residence is fixed and localised with the glaring injustice that we all know so well
Europe without frontiers overtaxes labour income to make up for not being able to tax capital income
This is why the Europe of free movement is a Europe that deprives people who are permanent residents in favour of nomads
Britain Labour MEPs support the principles behind the Commission proposals to prevent tax evasion on cross-border payments of interest to individuals
However these proposals as currently drafted are flawed and against the interests of employment in Europe financial services industry
The timing of the introduction of a withholding tax directive is crucial
Unilateral European Union level action runs the genuine risk of creating an outflow of capital to third countriesfor example Switzerland
Should this happen then jobs in EU financial centres will be lost to third countries as capital leaves
In addition there will be no benefit to exchequers as the taxable interest payments will be outside the Member States
It is not appreciated that Eurobonds or international securities are included within the scope of the directive
Such a move would also run the genuine risk of relocating the whole Eurobond market outside of the EU and in particular the City of London
British Labour MEPs are acutely conscious of the New York experience of imposing a unilateral tax on such financial services
For many years Eurobonds were almost exclusively traded in New York The introduction of a unilateral tax regime saw their near total relocation to London
As currently drafted therefore this directive poses a direct threat to between and jobs mainly in London financial services depending on whose analyses you believe
Indeed there are already clear indications of Swiss preparations for any new opportunities that may arise as a result of EU action
British Labour MEPs will be supporting calls for a multilateral policy development with the other OECD financial centres to tackle this important issue of tax evasion and for the exclusion of Eurobonds from this directive
In the absence of such amendments being carried British Labour MEPs will vote against this directive
Both the Commission proposal and the Pérez Royo report on introducing a minimum level of taxation on savings income undoubtedly deserve our support
Especially now with the single currency and the absence of any exchange risk this is the only way to rule out predatory fiscal competition
We must however be vigilant about competition in this area from third countries and should therefore demand particularly via the OECD that they too should apply minimum levels of taxation
We recognise that this cannot be expected immediately and must therefore agree with the amendment approved in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy in favour of a % rather than a % minimum rate to less the impact of any harmful competition
We therefore disagree with the rapporteur who has just told us that he would be voting for the % figure
Alongside the Code of Conduct adopted by the Council in an effort to avoid harmful tax competition among Member States the Commission has presented a text in the form of a proposal for a directive that is both premature and immature
It is premature because it lacks a global approach towards tax harmonisation
Harmonisation of taxation of savings is just one specific aspect of a harmonisation operation that must encompass a number of other areas of which company taxation is one of the most important
Harmonising only one part of the tax system is potentially more harmful than maintaining the different fiscal regimes that currently exist
As a result the true merit of a directive on harmonising taxation of savings can only be appreciated once the overall plan has been drawn up and approved
The text is immature because all of its components are largely controversial and their effects on the European economy are not known
The European Commission and the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy set out the principles on which agreement could be reached in time a withholding tax coexistence a common rate of withholding tax
But the practical application of these principles requires more careful consideration and above all solutions must first be found to many specific problems the definition of a realistic minimum rate of withholding tax coexistence yes but without the additional untransparent complications of a system of certificates and reimbursements paving the way for problems in the system imprecise definitions of the beneficial owner and the paying agent potentially negative consequences for the European financial markets if Eurobonds are included in this directive without exemption and so on
None of these problems has as yet been resolved and as a result this proposal for a directive can at the very most be considered as a preliminary draft that still requires intensive work
Some of Parliament amendments are a step in the right direction without necessarily touching on the fundamental problems the rate of the withholding tax has been lowered the role of certain neighbouring countries which will be the sole beneficiaries of the directive in its current version is mentioned the usefulness of a certain degree of fair tax competition and the subsequent beneficial reduction in fiscal pressure is underlined
Otherwise the report remains too close to the Commission text
Even though the explanatory statement is not part of the legislative text it contains several opinions with which I do not agree reducing the problem of Eurobonds to a purely British problem and above all the rapporteur ideal vision according to which an ideal fiscal regime should be based on the principle of supply of information to the fiscal authorities ie on the elimination of banking secrecy for fiscal purposes
For these reasons I am voting against the Pérez Royo report
I can support an effort being made to counter speculation due to the different rules on the taxation of interest on savings accounts in the EU Member States so as to ensure a modest minimum level of taxation
I can also support the Commission thinking as regards a minimum level of taxation but I would like to stress that this does not mean that the Danish Conservatives endorse an actual harmonisation of tax rates
I would also like to help bring about a certain exchange of information between Member States to make it possible for taxation to take place in one form or another
At the same time however we must ensure that new EU rules in this field do not encourage pension funds and other financial institutions currently based in the EU area to move to countries outside the European Union
It is not necessary to recall the origins of this proposal for a directive or the importance that the fiscal regime of interest assumes in the functioning of the single market especially when regarded in relation to the introduction of the euro
The first three lines of the rapporteur explanatory statement thus crudely reveal that the objective being pursued is to combat the pernicious yet entirely predictable effects of the creation of the euro on certain capital movements
As a result of the introduction of the euro in the single market the tax differentials between the various Member States are causing significant capital movements and attempts are now being made to curb these for example by introducing a minimum rate of taxation on income from capital invested by individuals
It is astonishing to note that the effects of the euro on capital movements were not properly understood before it was introduced
Regarding the report itself the Group of Independents for a Europe of Nations has voted in favour of the amendments spelling out the need to harmonise the basic principles of taxation with OECD members
If we introduce harmonisation that is limited only to the Member States of the European Union it is highly probable that we will witness the flight of capital to third countries
With regard to the minimum rate of taxation of interest paid our group voted in favour of the amendment by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy which lowers this minimum rate to % from the % rate proposed by the Commission a minimum rate that is too high could result in the flight of capital to third countries
EMU and the euro demand the harmonisation of fiscal policy within the European Union and the shaping of a single taxation framework for economic activity in all Member States
This attempt at equalisation pays scant regard to the different growth levels of each country to the repercussions that a single tax policy will have on national budgets to growth and social expenditure and above all to the incomes of working people
Its aim is to increase hard-hitting tax measures at the expense of working people and to lighten the tax burden on businesses and capital markets thereby increasing their profits
The fiscal policy which is taking shape little by little within the European Union a typical example of which is the proposal to tax income from savings that we are debating today will strengthen even further regional and social inequalities
It will make big business even more unaccountable and strengthen the divisions in economic life
The Commission proposal favours tax havens of all kinds and the multifarious exemptions that exist in the system for taxing large corporations
It taxes the interest on the savings of the small investor and the small saver and eases the tax burden on companies and large conglomerates
This is happening at a time when in the name of social security funding or the reduction of public deficits proposals are being elaborated or ideas are being put forward to further increase the burden of indirect taxation which blights the lives of the ordinary person in the street and to further reduce the public social provision of health and pension cover because of the high costs involved
It is clear that those who rule the EU believe that the enormous profits and revenues which can legally avoid any form of tax burden through a series of exemptions and derogations which are provided for in national tax laws such as revenues from financial products cannot and what is more must not play a role in achieving these aims
The people and the workers will bear the costs and the profits will go to large companies and the capital markets
We regard as unacceptable and at the same time revealing of the intentions of the EU and EMU the fact that the proposed directive only covers physical persons when we know that the vast majority of those entitled to hold foreign accounts or cross-border bonds government or not are the large institutional investors
Indeed it is extremely telling that the amendments which called for the directive to be extended to cover legal entities were rejected
It is incomprehensible to us that taxes should be instituted which exempt companies
Such a regulation is a harsh blow to employment and growth as it encourages capital to be kept in banks or to be converted into bonds or other financial products rather than into investments in production
This is not taxation Working people are being penalised for doing their utmost to save money
This regulation is simply paving the way for the corruption of economic life the exploitation of working people and the creation of brass-plate companies which are set up solely to avoid taxation
It is also creating the conditions and this is made easier by the convergence of interest rates to transfer accounts to a country other than the country of residence or to strengthen the cross-border market in bonds at the expense of the domestic market
The aim is to circumvent tax legislation for residents and to avoid paying tax
In particular this regulation makes it easier to use zero coupon bonds as a way of laundering money as they can be sold before their due date to people who are not covered by the directive and are therefore not subject to tax
The proposal for a directive that we are examining is part of a package adopted by the Council in December and we wish to reiterate that we wholly disagree with the logic of packages which aim to ward off any genuine objections which may arise and to allow decisions to be made which hurt the weakest countries
This is exactly what is happening with the proposal for a directive to tax the interest earned by affiliated companies which directly hurts Greece as it is an importer of capital
Taking advantage of the opportunity provided by the relevant forecast in the draft directive and bearing in mind that the start of a new round of multilateral negotiations is approaching we urge the Commission and the Council to take the necessary actions to institute at international level a means of ensuring that interest on bank deposits and revenues from bonds of all kinds and other financial products are taxed
Such actions must be targeted at large international institutional investors and more generally at legal entities
A way must also be found to tax all kinds of cross-border capital movements which are carried out for profit in order to put a brake albeit in a limited way on the increase in the volume of parasitic speculative capital
Lehne report A
In our view the opinion delivered by the European Parliament on this subject is the result of a compromise which is preventing Parliament from helping to advance the Commission continuing work in this area
Unfortunately the opinion is representative of the fact that the right particularly the PPE Group is working to ensure that Parliament becomes an obstacle to third-country nationals enjoying the rights to which they are entitled while in the European Union
A common set of rules defining the rights of third-country nationals and their freedom to travel and reside in the Member States is a precondition for all citizens being able to move around freely
In this context it is regrettable that the PPE Group and others are trying to restrict these rights and opportunities
Not only is it detrimental to the rights and opportunities of a number of third-country nationals but it also makes it more difficult to achieve the goal of the free movement of persons
We should like to make it clear that we are opposed to the ranking of people seeking work in a Member State in the following order citizens of the Member State itself citizens of the Union and third-country nationals as set out in Article 
Nor are we able to agree with the view expressed in Amendment No tabled by Mr Nassauer of the PPE Group in which he calls for the age limit for family reunification to be lowered to 
However we welcome Amendments Nos and which place partnerships on an equal footing with marriage in terms of family reunification although we are concerned that the wording of these amendments to EU rules detracts from the possibility of them being applied effectively in all the Member States
It is essential to point out at this stage that asylum seekers are covered by existing conventions aimed at protecting them against persecution
Different criteria must be applied to those wishing to enter the European Union on economic grounds
The key issue now under debate is whether we should have a strict or a relaxed admission policy
I would argue that if the European Union admits third country nationals for the purpose of servicing the specific needs of individual Member States labour shortages then it would be repulsive to adopt a revolving door policy by taking no responsibility for the tangible economic input of workers from third countries
I would further argue for a strict rather than a relaxed admission policy so as to protect the rights of third country nationals by outlining clearly the necessary criteria for admission
Harmonising Member States visa policies with regard to third countries is in my view essential as a major step towards improving the safety of travel documents
The mutual recognition of travel documents is paramount to implementing EU policy on the admission of third country nationals
From an Irish perspective the influx of refugees asylum seekers and immigrants is a relatively new experience for us as a nation
Mistakes have been made in dealing with this evolving problem by successive governments
I have to say I am angry at how some of our citizens treat these strangers
We can at times hide behind the provisions of the Dublin Convention which states that the first EU country that an asylum seeker enters must process their application for asylum
Ireland is seldom the first port of call for prospective asylum seekers
The Irish Government should be bold and courageous enough to bring in an amnesty for existing refugees and asylum seekers in Ireland
It should then introduce new and uniform rules to deal with new applications in the future
The Irish people must show some compassion on this issue
We more than most nations have benefited from the generosity of spirit and kindness of other nations in our history most notably Britain Australia and the United States of America
The very fact that Ireland is currently experiencing an unprecedented economic boom must mean that we do not forget our humanitarian duty to others
Immigration in Europe is one of the areas which we have dealt with least during the present parliamentary term and as a result the work done in this area is largely superficial
However the Amsterdam Treaty which is to be implemented in the near future obliges us to broadly review the current status quo with a view to implementing new immigration measures
All this will very probably lead to numerous problems in view of the current inflow of persons and the inability of the European Union to become an outlet for world poverty
One of the major difficulties will consist in making the distinction between foreign nationals who have already been resident in the European Union for several years and those who have just arrived
Hence the importance of new provisions in the Amsterdam Treaty which differentiate with a considerable degree of humanity between short-term and long-term residence and immigration and temporary asylum policy
In the face of the numerous political conflicts currently taking place throughout the world including on our continent we cannot close our eyes and just turn away asylum seekers saying that they are not our concern
Significant progress has been made with regard to the idea of collective responsibility of a group of nations
European legislation must therefore act as a very strict barrier to foreseeable inflows of persons
The same applies to economic immigration the criteria for which must be laid down very clearly
The European Parliament has always ardently defended very strict international rules that can be applied in practice
Controlling our migratory inflows is becoming a major issue particularly on the eve of enlargement when a number of third country nationals will soon become full citizens
I therefore approve the second Lehne report because it takes into consideration the realities of the world today without being too liberal and causing harm to our own nationals but leaving the door open to integration that is controlled in terms of the number of immigrants and in terms of time
The European Parliament needs to find the right balance
Immigration must not constitute an obstacle to European cooperation programmes but for all that we cannot refuse positive immigration nor can we reject agreements with third countries
Today the Danish Social Democrats voted in favour of a report concerning uniform rules for the admission of third-country nationals to the Member States
In Denmark there has been a halt on immigration since 
We have some very tough rules on immigration for the purpose of paid employment
Age patterns in the Member States and a general upturn in the economy mean that we are going to have a shortage of labour in some sectors in the near future
We may therefore be forced to consider how persistently this halt on immigration should be maintained
Lehne report A
Requiring people to have visas creates a number of awkward problems for third-country nationals wishing to travel and reside in the Member States
As regards common rules for granting visas we think there are two aspects to be borne in mind On the one hand the rules should make it possible for everyone residing within the Union to move around and on the other they should be applied in a spirit of generosity that will enable third-country nationals to travel and reside so far as is practicable in the Member States
We do not foresee any conflict between these two aspects
In this respect we welcome the committee draft report since it emphasises the need for more latitude in the rules relating to visas
The draft Convention on rules for the admission of third-country nationals to the Member States of the Union is quite obviously responding to a need to try to introduce minimum conditions for the crossing of EU external borders in order to avoid wide gaps allowing immigrants to enter a Member State and then move throughout the whole of Europe
However this text which has clearly been carefully negotiated by the Council has been damaged by the European Parliament amendments
At any rate it is affected by a structural defect which calls for serious reservations on our part possible revision would be practically out of the question
In fact Article provides that the Council shall unanimously decide on any amendments to the Convention which might seem logical given that the text will have been adopted unanimously
However this provision poses a problem because if unanimity governs the adoption of a text it ends up being ultraconservative and even intransigent when it comes to its revision
In fact the proper rule which should be laid down is that when a text has been adopted unanimously the failure of one Member State to give its support by requesting that it be revised must automatically lead to improvements being made to it
This is not a hypothetical question
It is currently being raised in France in relation to the directive on the conservation of wild birds
It could be raised tomorrow in relation to the Convention on rules for the admission of third-country nationals for example if a signatory country requests amendments to the rules on family reunification
Nor is there anything extraordinary about this question no text can remain unchanged forever and it is normal to provide the means to make changes to it in the future
Moreover an additional problem arises in the Convention we are dealing with today if a country which had not managed to successfully renegotiate a text wanted to be withdrawn by democratic means from part of or all of the text it would be difficult to see how this would be possible when as provided for by the Amsterdam Treaty it would not have the right to re-establish unilaterally certain checks at its internal borders
We may therefore find it quite strange that governments are pursuing such conventions without having resolved problems as serious as these beforehand and without having taken all the necessary precautions
Demands relating to the desire to harmonise immigration and visa policies are also made in Mr Lehne report
The rapporteur original idea like that of Mrs Lindeperg whose report results from the same logic despite the fact that they belong to different political groups is that in view of the present difficulties in these areas the policies can no longer be dealt with at national level alone
The draft Amsterdam Treaty should therefore allow the simultaneous harmonisation of visa policies without which the free movement of persons implementation of a fair asylum policy harmonisation of immigration rules action to combat illegal immigration and effective checks at the external borders would be jeopardised
The report has undoubtedly been produced within the context of the ratification of the draft Amsterdam Treaty
It establishes a provisional regulation the Commission having already undertaken to submit a fresh proposal in the form of a directive as soon as the amendments agreed in the Amsterdam Treaty enter into force
However in the explanatory statement of the proposal for a Council Act the Commission considers that current economic factors and the situation on the labour market make it impossible to do away with selective admission policies formulated by the Member States for the purposes of paid employment or independent economic activity
Nevertheless it persists in believing that it is Europe duty to adopt a global approach with regard to immigration policies
What about the problems experienced by immigrant populations integrating into societies which already have difficulty defining structures for human and social relations both internally and with other societies
What about the economic and social cost of such measures
What about the checks I mentioned at the Community external borders which we know do not actually exist or are ineffective in certain regions
How much flexibility will the Member States have to react to special situations in view of a safeguard clause providing for an exception whose duration is limited to what is strictly necessary and taking into account the interests of other Member States which the state keeps closely informed as well as the Commission
All these questions remain unanswered today
Too much is at stake for us to venture into the unknown in this way
The road to hell is paved with good intentions
This maxim is too easily applied to the spirit of Mr Lehne reports
Politics is the art of reality not of utopia
The generations of this century have been paying too high a price for this since for us to transform the European Union of tomorrow into a vast Yugoslavia in the name of false generosity
The Amsterdam Treaty and Schengen both give the EU greater discretion as regards immigration visas and asylum and the report is an extension of this policy
However the committee is of the opinion that the report does not go far enough in respect of the harmonisation of visa requirements in the individual Member States
The existence of common rules for visas makes the European Union more like a state
For a number of countries it also means that some third-country nationals would have to apply for visas to enter the Union
There is also a strong possibility that such a policy would serve to reinforce the external borders and encourage an inflexible approach to refugees and immigrants
Consequently I have voted against the report
Lindeperg report A
Madam President in the Lindeperg report which has just been voted on the European Parliament calls for the upwards harmonisation these are the words used in the explanatory statement of forms of protection complementary to refugee status
In fact the Geneva Convention of July signed by all the Member States of the Union provides for this status to be granted to individuals persecuted in their country of origin on grounds of race religion nationality membership of a social group or political opinion the European Parliament thinks this is too restrictive
In particular it would like a broader definition of the recognised causes of persecution to include gender-specific causes for example and of potential persecutors whose definition would no longer be confined to state bodies
In addition to a less restrictive interpretation of the definitions of the Geneva Convention which would open up the way for a complementary refugee status a temporary protection scheme for displaced persons is being set up at the same time by the European Union in order to offer a full range of legal structures for reception to all individuals or groups of persons wanting to flee their country of origin for one reason or another
The proposal which the European Parliament is making with regard to this complementary status seems to me to be completely typical of how it usually acts
It is announced that the new status will grant rights without taking the trouble to say which ones and merely giving the impression that they will not be subject to a time-limit
No attempt is made to ascertain how many new refugees there will be as a result directly or indirectly nor how much all of this will cost the taxpayer
Of course there is no mention anywhere in the report of what the citizens of the Member States might think about this
For our part we consider that this is a completely irresponsible way of doing things
Of course the countries of Europe must show concern for the welfare of foreigners who have been persecuted firstly by scrupulously applying the provisions of the Geneva Convention
However this solicitude can take very different forms one of which being residence on our territories for an unlimited duration which we would have to reject more or less outright
Madam President I am making this explanation of vote not only on my own behalf but also on behalf of the Spanish delegation in the Group of the European People Party
We abstained in the vote on this report and I think that I should give you an explanation as to why we neither voted in favour or against This is particularly important since an issue such as this is perhaps one that requires us to take a particular stance which is what the Spanish delegation in the PPE Group is doing
We are naturally in favour of harmonising complementary forms of protection so that refugees who do not meet the conditions laid down in the Geneva Convention yet who truly deserve protection will receive it
That is why we have not voted against the report
We agree with the rapporteur and the majority of this House about the objectives involved
However we did not vote in favour of the report because it contains serious flaws In addition to its legal shortcomings it also tries to force an interpretation of the Geneva Convention on us which is totally contrary to international law
However it was essentially political reasons that prevented us from voting in favour of the report the demagogy it uses only serves to harm the interests it aims to protect
This therefore explains the constructive abstention of the Spanish delegation in the PPE Group
We should like to thank the rapporteur for his very thorough work on an urgently needed report
We think there is good reason to focus attention on the serious deficiencies that exist in the Union reception procedure for asylum-seekers
The report deserves praise for the way in which it discusses the measures that will be required to create a workable common refugee policy in which compassion solidarity and generosity play a major role in determining the Member States responsibility for accepting refugees
With regard to the amendment tabled by the GUENGL Group relating to Abdullah Ocalan we do not believe that the matter really comes within the ambit of the present discussion
Unfortunately we note from the amendment tabled by the rightist UPE and PPE Groups that the difficulties which the Council had in reaching agreement on a common refugee policy are also reflected in the narrow attitude displayed by these groups in the European Parliament
The way in which this matter has been handled shows yet again the ideological divide that exists between the right and left in Europe in their approach to a humane and generous refugee policy
We regret that the same ideological differences have served to deprive Amendments Nos and relating to persecution on the grounds of sexual proclivity of the support they warranted from the European Parliament
Today the Danish Social Democrats voted in favour of a report on the need to adopt common rules in addition to the Geneva Convention
There is a need for European cooperation on refugee questions
The first step towards a common refugee policy was taken with the adoption of the Geneva Convention
The next step should be some common rules for people who are not covered by the latter
These are people who are not being persecuted individually by the State for political reasons but who need asylum on other humanitarian grounds
The Member States should have a uniform interpretation of how these people can be assured of proper protection
It is time for us to start discussing a common definition of de facto and other humanitarian protection
There should be certain minimum standards with which all the Member States are obliged to comply
Since the start of the s the European Union has been experiencing an influx of refugees who have fled their countries of origin for various reasons
Many of them do not fall into the category of refugees as defined by the Geneva Convention
However the European Union cannot refuse these persons entry into its territory
In fact sending them back to their country of origin without further ado would put their lives at risk or would at the very least jeopardise their moral or physical integrity
Harmonisation of the policies pursued by the Member States is necessary in this area and this will be possible as soon as the Amsterdam Treaty has entered into force
Within this framework we need to set up an instrument to harmonise the forms of protection complementing refugee status
I broadly agree with the rapporteur on all these points
In fact I believe as she does that the European Union must grant a specific status to persons who cannot claim refugee status within the meaning of the Geneva Convention
The debate is mainly concerned with the definition of the categories which are eligible for this complementary status
It seems to me that a number of points still need to be clarified
One example will illustrate my view whatever we think otherwise of the death penalty can a person who at the end of a fair trial is sentenced to death for crimes and offences under civil law having exhausted all the possibilities of legal redress really enjoy the specific status I mentioned as the rapporteur seems to suggest under the pretext that capital punishment has been abolished by the Member States of the European Union
If so on what terms
Can a condemned person be given the same status as for example a woman fleeing her country of origin because she has fears of being subjected to sexual violence or inhuman or degrading treatment
This type of question is at the very least worth taking time to discuss in depth
Complementary status is essential
I just think that the dossier is not ready yet
I am therefore voting against this report and urge that the debate be continued
The June Movement is going to vote for the Lindeperg report to show our willingness to accept refugees
The Lindeperg report is more humane than the policy which the civil servants and justice ministers are planning
But for the record we should not forget to point out that it should be for the Member States themselves to decide on immigration and refugee policy
We do not want any supranational cooperation in this area because refugee policy is improved if the people have the opportunity to endorse it
In the main this is a balanced document which addresses some very important fundamental issues
I sincerely hope that the amendments tabled by the Conservative groups are not adopted
They would only detract from the quality of the report as the aim of those political groups is not to make life easier for refugees and asylum-seekers
Consequently I hope that Amendments Nos and relating to homosexuals tabled by the ARE Group are adopted by the House
The matter should be taken very seriously since homosexuals are persecuted in many countries
Some countries mete out a range of punishments including the death penalty for a person sexual predilections
Freedom from persecution or harassment because of one sexual predilections is a basic human right
It is essential that this should be taken into account in the discussions on asylum legislation as well as with regard to protection for homosexuals
I cannot endorse the Lindeperg report because I do not think that asylum policy should be a matter for the EU
In my opinion this belongs solely at national level
Of course individual countries are morally and politically obliged to comply with whatever international conventions there may be in this field both in letter and in spirit
The rich democracies in particular are obliged to take a lead where the protection of the persecuted people of the world is concerned which includes providing asylum themselves for those who are being persecuted
However my rejection of the report on grounds of political principle should not overshadow the fact that Mrs Lindeperg clearly deals with an important matter in a proper and humane way
An example is her highlighting of the problem that there are people today who in reality are refugees but who are not recognised as such according to the definition of the term contained in the Geneva Convention
I would like to point out however that it would be a grave mistake for the EU to set about creating an alternative definition of refugees
That would be contrary to the principle that refugees are protected by an international convention agreed under international auspices
At the same time I could well imagine that an EU agreement on a different definition of refugees would not be seen as an addition to the Geneva Convention but as a step towards depriving the Geneva Convention of its substance so that many more people could be turned away with a clear conscience at the EU external borders
The general impression of the EU and not least of its Member States is not that they want to expand the definition of refugees but on the contrary that they wish to restrict it
The Danish Prime Minister said before the Danish referendum on the Amsterdam Treaty that a yes to the Amsterdam Treaty will mean fewer refugees in Denmark
The report by our colleague Mrs Lindeperg totally misses the main point of the asylum seeker problem in the European Union which is that we are not in fact facing a real asylum problem at all but an asylum cheating problem
That is something totally different
Everybody knows that just a few percent of asylum seekers in Europe can justifiably invoke the recognised international conventions on asylum
If the hundreds of thousands of asylum cheaters who arrive every year to benefit from social security in our Member States were systematically and effectively sent back over the borders then there would be no asylum problem at all in Europe
You may be shocked by the use of the term asylum cheater
Yet it has the benefit of clarity highlights a reality and contains no human condemnation
There are only two possible approaches here either you play at being Santa Claus and say all foreigners are welcome in Europe and can be supported by us or you must apply the existing agreements to the letter in which the case the asylum cheaters must be sent back to their own countries not just because they put the whole asylum system at risk and thus harm genuine asylum seekers but also because in Europe itself there are many poor and underprivileged to whom we first owe an obligation before we can take all the suffering of the world on our shoulders
Mrs Lindeperg clearly opts for the Santa Claus policy
But she is playing Santa Claus at the taxpayers expense
If her proposals for a further undermining of asylum regulations were to become a reality the final barrier would be down and we would risk being swamped by fortune seekers from all over the world
This is therefore an irresponsible report yet another to come before Parliament that we will not be approving
The sitting was suspended at pm and resumed at pm
Progress on Agenda 
The next item is the statement by the Council on progress on Agenda 
I give the floor to the President-in-Office of the Council
Mr President ladies and gentlemen when Mr Fischer presented the programme of the German Presidency here approximately a month ago in his capacity of President-in-Office of the Council the first priority he listed for this six-month term was the successful conclusion of the Agenda negotiations by the time of the special European Council meeting on and March
It is now just six weeks to the day until this meeting which will be held in Berlin at the request of Chancellor Schröder
The negotiations on the individual components of the Agenda which we have been conducting intensively since the Commission submitted its legislative proposals eleven months ago and at full stretch since the beginning of the year have now reached a crucial phase
I am glad that at this stage I can now discuss Agenda with you in detail
Let me start with a brief outline of the timetable up to the special summit
By the time of the General Affairs Council and Agriculture Council in just under a fortnight time we will have had a first run-through of all the major components of the global compromise to be reached by the Council bodies and Councils
This first consideration of the key questions under the aegis of the General Affairs Council the Economic and Financial Affairs Council and the Agriculture Council has already proved fairly successful in terms of reaching compromises and consensus on some aspects
But it also became clear that we still have an enormous way to go and very little time to do so
The Heads of State and Government will assess the progress made to date especially the results we hope to see from the Agriculture Council on and February at their informal summit in Bonn on February
We expect this meeting to which Chancellor Schröder has also invited the President of the European Parliament to provide important guidelines for the further activities of the final phase
Immediately after the Bonn summit we will after all have to start tying up the package that the Heads of State and Government are to finish negotiating on and bring to a political conclusion at the end of March and during April under the responsibility of the General Affairs Council as the coordinating body
For the rest you could regard the fact that Chancellor Schröder has moved the special summit from Brussels to Bonn as a sign of our strong commitment to bringing the negotiations to a successful conclusion
The German Presidency will do its utmost to achieve that successful conclusion
We have become convinced that other Member States are also firmly resolved to achieve it and therefore want to conduct the negotiations in a constructive and positive manner
Everybody realises that a balanced package is the only solution and that there can be no winners or losers
Each Member State must have its appropriate say on the final result but at the same time each must make its contribution to achieving that result
Everything must be laid out openly on the table There can be no taboo subjects
It is of paramount importance to the Union and thus to all the Member States and all the partner states realise this for us to be able to declare the European Union the winner at the end of March for one thing is sure Europe could very easily become the loser
Putting it off will not make the solution any easier on the contrary
If a few months after the entry into force of monetary union and indeed only a few weeks before the June elections to the European Parliament we disappointed people hopes that we would prove capable of action the consequences would be very serious
If the European Union which since the beginning of this year has become a new financial market with global influence and global responsibility cannot also resolutely assume the corresponding political responsibility on the basis also of the Amsterdam Treaty then too Europe would be the loser
And if the momentum of the enlargement negotiations is weakened and the date of their conclusion is postponed the effects would be so damaging as to set us back in our work for a long time
I hope these and other arguments will prompt all the Member States to make more and even greater concerted efforts
Meanwhile it is generally realised that unlike the case of the earlier Delors I and Delors II packages this time it will not be possible to reach a compromise in the end by making extra funds available
On the contrary the unequal burden-sharing that resulted from this kind of approach in earlier cases must be corrected this time for the sake of the legitimacy and future viability of the European Union
I do not think any of our partners questions the principle of fair burden-sharing just as they cannot question the principle of solidarity which is the constitutive principle of the European Union
One basic condition for the success of the negotiations as a whole is that the Heads of State and Government decided in Vienna to include all the components of the Agenda in the discussion and only to seek a solution in the form of an overall package
Everything is laid out on the table
That means a balance can be found covering every aspect and the combination of various parameters ensures that the further negotiations will be sufficiently flexible and dynamic
In many areas of the Agenda it has proved possible to broaden the basis of agreement over the past weeks
This applies in particular to the reform of the Structural Funds where consensus has now been reached on major issues
I am thinking for instance of the reduction of the number of objectives from seven to three the reduction of the number of Community initiatives and the long-disputed question of coherence between national aid and EU aid I am also thinking of the efficiency performance reserve where gratifying progress was made at the last General Affairs Council
On other important questions such as strict adherence to the % criterion for Objective areas and reserving some two thirds of funds for Objective the discussions have already produced clear majorities
Here you must not forget that under the Austrian Presidency broad political agreement was already reached on the pre-accession instruments that are so important to enlargement policy
The same applies to the financial regulation on trans-European networks
In both areas structural reform and pre-accession instruments I held talks yesterday with European Parliament representatives under the informal consultation procedure continuing those that were begun under the Austrian Presidency
We attach the utmost importance to this dialogue at political level as a means of concluding the Agenda successfully and on schedule
In the coming weeks we will therefore carry on with this dialogue intensively and in a constructive spirit
Mr Fischer gave another assurance to that effect in his reply to the letter from your President Mr Gil-Robles Gil-Delgado
Dialogue is not a one-way street
The Council will take account in its decision-making of the positions expressed by the European Parliament during these discussions
The informal consultation forms part of our endeavour to provide Parliament with comprehensive information at all times as reflected in our debate today and our offer to hold an exchange of views on Agenda at any time in an informal political trialogue
We are well aware that not only the Council but especially you the Members of the European Parliament will have an important part to play in resolving the Agenda-related problems in good time
Our presidency will do all it can to cooperate closely with you on a basis of trust
Applause
I do not need to remind the President-in-Office of how essential it is to meet the timetable not only to secure the necessary democratic legitimacy for the Agenda package but also to allow programmes and policies to be implemented in a timely and effective manner
We welcome his efforts in this respect
We however need to make progress on our priorities
Parliament priorities on the general framework regulation are in fact clear
As regards the modified proposal on the efficiency performance reserve Parliament must be involved in decisions on the mid-term review and the reallocation of the national reserve
What role for Parliament can the presidency and the Council envisage to guarantee effective parliamentary scrutiny of the reserve mechanism
Thirty-four pages of guidelines have been produced by the Commission for the operation of regional programmes
How will these relate to the regulations
How will they be discussed in the Council
The guidelines underline the vital role of urban areas in the European economy
Will the presidency demonstrate its commitment to urban areas by arguing in favour of Parliament priority requiring continuation of the URBAN Community initiative
The Commission reform proposal does not contain any contingency plans for unexpected economic and social restructuring in the regions
Does the presidency agree that it would be wise to set aside some resources under a special Community initiative for unexpected crises to enable the Union to act in such situations
Likewise is the presidency prepared to promote this priority in the Council
Finally partnership is a key priority for Parliament in ensuring that the Europe we build and its policies are genuinely inclusive supporting a People Europe
For this reason we want a strong partnership pact in both designing drafting and implementing the new generation of programmes
Will the presidency back Parliament demands in the Council for a strengthened partnership pact and what concrete and practical actions will the presidency take to ensure that partnership is not just an optional extra but an integral component of all programmes strengthening the cohesion of a People Europe
Mr President having just listened to the presentation by the Council we cannot immediately say that it has provided a great deal of information
We are in fact very much interested in the Council own activities concerning enlargement and in particular how the Council views the state of progress in the negotiations
Is it the case as we often read at present and also hear from the various think tanks that we are already thinking about discussing accession dates for certain countries
There are certain reports to this effect and there is a great deal of optimism and we have also heard the Foreign Ministers of certain Member States say that it is time to set accession dates
It has always been the case with the enlargement strategy that both the Commission and the negotiators have said that this would be the wrong approach that the accession date is a matter for the country itself and not the Commission or the European institutions as such
The countries themselves must satisfy the rules and conditions for membership and it is our job to encourage progress
It has always been said that setting dates for certain countries would be an encouragement for them to be rather less energetic in their efforts as it would be seen as a kind of guarantee of membership
Is there any reason to review that position and now to say it is better to set dates after all
What would be the reason for this
Do you see any virtue in this
Secondly we are seeing that public opinion is changing and this is affecting the negotiations
In some applicant countries public opinion is becoming progressively less positive towards membership of the European Union
It is perhaps also true that in many cases there is a serious lack of knowledge about the Union as also in the Member States at present
Is there not good cause for the Council too to encourage a drastic improvement in information on the European Union in the applicant countries
Mr President first of all I should like to express my appreciation to the German Presidency for taking the trouble to come here this afternoon in order to explain how far negotiations have progressed
I am pleased that Mr Verheugen has said that everything is on the table during these negotiations
I should like to stress that fair burden-sharing is one of the important points in this whole negotiating process and I believe that this must not be ignored when we talk about support for Europe
Over recent weeks Parliament has voted on the main points of Agenda 
We voted on structural policy and on agricultural policy
If my calculations are correct we are planning to spend considerably more than what I read at present in newspaper reports on the Agenda negotiations
I believe there is a danger here that we will not reach agreement on the financial perspectives
If my knowledge of the rules is correct votes are needed and when I saw the voting pattern on the main points here in Parliament we seemed to be very divided
I would also warn against assuming in advance that if there is agreement in the Council on drastic spending cuts Parliament will automatically approve them
I fear this is not so
We would then fall back on Article which would mean that we would be spending considerably more than the Finance Ministers generally want to see or consider desirable in relation to the launch of the euro and so on
I am a member of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development and I should also like to say something about agriculture
I would warn against the general view that everything spent on agriculture is a waste of money
I am not just saying this because of this morning demonstration here in Strasbourg
Too often I hear that half of the European budget goes to % of the population and so on
I believe we must see this in relation to all tax revenue
When I look at the tax burden in Europe approximately % of the gross national product my calculations tell me that approximately % goes to % of the population
That is certainly not excessive
We must of course always ensure that money is not wasted
We must have no more surpluses and keep production within limits
But we need to keep agricultural management in Europe basically as it is and I think the German Presidency would do well to try to achieve this
Mr President-in-Office you have just said that there would be neither winners nor losers in the general agreement that you hope to develop between now and the Berlin summit
We saw today that there were many French and German tractors in Strasbourg
If my information is correct there will also be many tractors on February in Brussels and these will come from all over the European Union
We understand the farmers concerns
The common agricultural policy is the European Union main common policy
They are worried because they cannot subscribe to the Commission proposals
Moreover I am very surprised that Mr Fischler is not on the Commission bench while two other Commissioners concerned with the Agenda package are present
The Commission proposals are going to bring a drop in prices that will not be fully compensated but if my information is correct the Council would favour more moderate reductions in prices but with a reduction in compensatory aid
I would therefore like you to explain how when agricultural revenue fell by almost % throughout the European Union in you will ensure that there are no losers among farmers when the final package is presented
I would like to know what the Council current thoughts are on this matter
Mr President I should like to begin by saying that we obviously all agree that reaching agreement on such an important matter as this should not be put off indefinitely
But I would also say that a good agreement is better than agreement at any price we should not seek just any agreement but rather a good one especially since it will remain in force for seven years
I must also refer to an underlying problem in this area both in the original Commission proposal and in the proposals that have been discussed in the Council we have noted the same thing a lowering of own resources from % to % in the case of the Commission proposal entirely to the detriment of the structural funds and actions
How can that be acceptable
I should therefore like to ask the Council how it can reconcile this situation with the fundamental principle of economic and social cohesion enshrined in the Treaties
And what can you tell us about own resources Mr President-in-Office
Mr President I welcome the President-in-Office here this afternoon
Could he tell us firstly what pressure he is under from the Finance Ministers to bring about a deal within the financial limits they require
Will he be able in the longer term to bring about a deal under which the European Union will be able to finance the extra support that is required because of the cuts in prices
Is it not time to face up to reality and accept that this reform as proposed will not work
It will be more expensive to the budget and the consumer will not get any benefit
The processors and the retailers will eat it all up
We saw the demonstration here today and know that agriculture throughout Europe is in a serious state
My problem is that when I go back to my farmers and tell them of % cuts in beef and % cuts in milk they do not understand
Nor do they want to understand it
The most recent statistics indicate a % fall in income in my region during This is on top of other serious falls in and 
Turning to the regional aspect I understand that yesterday in Bonn the President-in-Office met my party leader David Trimble First Minister Designate from the Northern Ireland Assembly
I understand that during that time you had discussions with him on support for Northern Ireland under Objective and our position in the future
As you will know politics in Northern Ireland is at a very delicate stage at this moment in time
Could you tell us if you were able to reassure him that the Council will be supportive to Northern Ireland in the future
The fact remains that if the Republic of Ireland and border counties achieve Objective status and Northern Ireland does not that will be unacceptable
Mr President the meeting of the ECOFIN Council of February marked the collapse of negotiations on Agenda 
A joint text setting out the financial framework is vital to enable finance ministers to allow their opposite numbers in the agriculture ministries to implement the long-debated reform of the common agricultural policy but there was no consensus
The German minister Mr Lafontaine went too far and instead of confining himself to the subject of agricultural spending structural spending and own resources sought to widen the debate
The result was disagreement and in effect a decision to stabilise spending for the period
The countries in favour of freezing agricultural spending lined up with the position of the German Presidency leaving the question of the CAP worryingly unresolved while outside the Chamber the farmers anger is becoming a genuine cause for concern especially as the next few days will see demonstrators from all over Europe joining those who are here today
Mr President Mr President-in-Office I would like to ask four specific questions
Firstly are you working on the basis of the Commission proposal or on the information provided by the Austrian Presidency
Secondly given that the Union main objectives are to strengthen the euro and create employment what resources are being set aside for these in the financial perspective
Thirdly as regards the fair distribution of payments how are you going to remedy the fact that under the agricultural policy % of farmers receive %of the funds
And finally as regards enlargement do you plan to divide up the budget in the areas of agriculture and the Structural Funds in particular and if enlargement does not fit in with the Cohesion Fund to separate regional funding too
Mr President I too have noticed that there has been a delay in negotiations in the Council
If you were to continue at this rate Mr President-in-Office and I do not want to level criticism at you personally or at the German Presidency you are not going to be able to stick to the timetable that you yourself have set
It is clear that unlike the Council the European Parliament after painstaking debate has been able to adopt coherent positions on the issues arising under Agenda 
Back in November last year Parliament set out its priorities regarding the general framework regulation
Perhaps I may be allowed to mention a few of them
Firstly we said that % of Community GDP should be made available for structural actions
I understand the pressure that is exerted by public opinion in the richer Member States However we must not forget that the EU budget despite all the ambitious targets it sets is currently equivalent to that of Spain
Secondly we said that exactly and not approximately two thirds of Objective resources should be made available and that we must stick to the criteria defined by the Commission for including regions under Objective one of which states that only those regions with a per capita GDP which is less than % of Community GDP can be included
Thirdly we said that priority status should be given to Interreg and that there should be a special part relating to cooperation with islands and among island regions
Fourthly we opposed the efficiency performance reserve as originally proposed by the Commission
Proposals for a smaller reserve of % with national top-ups are a move in the right direction
I also want to make two points in connection with the Cohesion Fund
Firstly Mr President-in-Office I think that we must respect the Treaty which provides that Member States with less than % of Community GDP must participate in the Cohesion Fund
Secondly I would like you to tell me to what extent the positions of Parliament will be taken into consideration as it is obvious that the European Parliament is not prepared to budge from these positions
Of course we will discuss and negotiate but we cannot adopt stances which are completely out of line with these priorities
Mr President Mr President-in-Office I do not know if the Presidency-in-Office is fully aware of the fact that large sectors of European public opinion currently think of Agenda as a threat rather than as a necessity or an opportunity
Nor do I know if the Presidency-in-Office is aware that this is largely due to the way in which Austria and now Germany are approaching this issue
In my view they are putting an overly unilateral slant on the work and giving too much consideration to the pressure of public opinion within their own countries rather than taking an overall view of the European Union as they should do
Clearly the basic problem in my view lies in the fact that the ceiling for own resources is insufficient
However it is also true of course that the debate has concentrated on expenditure and forgotten about revenue
There is no doubt that we need an agreement that not only guarantees but also develops the principle of social and economic cohesion together with the relevant instruments
We also need to have a proper debate not so much on how to reduce those instruments but on how to increase the contributions from all the Member States fairly
For example what is the Presidency view of the proposal to include the criterion of relative prosperity in the chapter on revenue
Does the Presidency agree with the French proposal for some form of aggressive measures for the Cohesion Fund which to my mind would be unacceptable
Mr President I have two questions for the Council
The first concerns the pre-accession aids
Pre-accession aids are to be coordinated in the PHARE committee without as it seems now the presence of the applicant countries themselves
To what extent can this kind of pre-accession strategy be described as being based on partnership
My second question to the Council concerns the regional Structural Fund component in the EU
How much importance does the Council assign to the principles of partnership in the Structural Fund regulation especially the participation of the environmental partners the participation of the environmental NGOs the participation of representatives of equal opportunities for women and of the social partners
Mr President-in-Office we discovered yesterday evening that we agree to a very wide extent on the pre-accession funds
Even though the Austrian Presidency already achieved a consensus that is to say a consensus was already reached during the Austrian Presidency I do of course have to ask again how far you can still take Parliament decisions into consideration
We saw positive steps in that direction yesterday but I believe you should clarify once again whether there is in fact still any chance of movement here
Let me also say a few words on the Structural Funds
The current debate that centres on the need to stabilise expenditure and ensure fair burden-sharing is certainly right but we in the European Union have another task before us which must always be given due consideration it is the question of job creation
Here I will take up the cudgels for the Structural Funds and for maintaining these policies as far as possible
Structural aid is targeted at forward-looking development models and economic sectors which have the potential to create new employment opportunities
Is the Council aware that we must set this as a priority
Fighting unemployment and creating jobs is in fact the top priority and this is reflected in Agenda too where it is very strongly emphasised
Mr President Mr President-in-Office Commissioners the President-in-Office said that the choice of Berlin as the seat of the European Council is a symbol of how important the Presidency believes it is to bring Agenda to a conclusion in time to allow this Parliament to complete its legislative procedures before the European elections
He pointed out that the final agreement should not have any winners or losers and that Europe must be the only winner
We agree with that
But he also said that at this stage there will be no additional budgetary resources and he stressed in particular that the budgetary burden should be more fairly distributed
Up to now Mr President-in-Office none of the proposals that the Presidency has put forward in the Community institutions be they in official documents or in non-papers appear to look for a compromise to ensure that this burden is fairly distributed between all those involved Instead they only appear to consider the decision to reduce Community expenditure which is beyond any logical justification
With all due respect you are planning a reduction in agricultural expenditure of almost EUR million almost EUR m per year and a reduction in Category expenditure of EUR m almost EUR m per year without any justification in the light of Commission reports on cohesion This does not seem to reflect a compromise that has no winners or losers
I would therefore like to ask the German Presidency the following question when is the Presidency going to put forward truly balanced proposals for a compromise in which all the Member States will participate with each country naturally prepared to make allowances that might enable us to reach an agreement when necessary
Up to now Mr President-in-Office there has been little progress in the informal negotiations between Parliament and the Council Parliament merely sets out its views and the Council takes note of them
We were in the same situation with the Austrian Presidency and we have very little time left now to conclude important agreements
Mr President Mr President-in-Office allow me to link the beginning of your speech with the end
You said that the main priority was Agenda and ensuring that it reached a conclusion on time while at the same time you said that you hoped for our cooperation
I think you should have added something there
It is not that you hope for our cooperation but that you need it
The financial perspective forms part of the Interinstitutional Agreement and by its very definition the Interinstitutional Agreement is an agreement between institutions
Therefore it is not enough for you to reach an agreement with the members of the Council You must put forward a proposal that Parliament is satisfied with and as Mr Mulder pointed out it will require votes to be approved
What proposals can you put forward that might satisfy us
Have you already considered some kind of flexibility mechanism or would you prefer us to apply Article 
You cannot call for more Europe in every way and more policies try to combat unemployment and proceed with enlargement while providing less funds to do so
I think that a clear proposal is needed here And in conclusion I would like to ask whether we are soon going to see signs that social democrats are in the majority in the Council
Mr President Mr President-in-Office of the Council except for the fact that you once used the term Agriculture Council you have actually succeeded in speaking for minutes without even once really mentioning the reform of agricultural policy as the agricultural spokesman for my group I do feel a little hurt
But I will probably manage to stop myself from asking you your views on voluntary set-aside since you will certainly not be able to answer that question
But there is one thing I would like to know
I understand from a major German newspaper that as from the year for field crops for beef and for milk products the respective compensatory payments will be reduced cumulatively by % a year and that the intention is to reuse only % of these cuts for special agricultural measures which means that % goes back into the EU budget
Let me ask you quite plainly if this % of aid is removed again then as I see it that will lead to a spectacular increase in the net contributor position of some states
That in turn will produce a further redistribution at the cost of those who already pay a large amount into the EU and get far less back
I would be grateful if a little more could be said about this issue at least in relation to Agenda since it does after all have something to do with agricultural policy
Mr President we already had an opportunity yesterday to exchange views with the presidency of the Council on Parliament demands in relation to the Social Fund
But who could know better than you Mr President-in-Office that political demands can only succeed if they are repeated again and again
Yesterday you announced that the German Presidency of the Council felt great sympathy for our concerns
Yet I would like to formally ask you again today whether the German Presidency of the Council is also prepared where necessary to actually firmly support these demands in the Council namely the demands that in future % of Social Fund money is allocated to preventive labour market policies and specific aid measures for women that people who are already marginalised socially are given an opportunity to work through the Social Fund that the Member States assume obligations in all five intervention areas and that the target groups are designated centrally and finally that in future % of Social Fund resources for global subsidies is earmarked for local projects
Mr President Mr President-in-Office we are aware that this is an important time we are planning for the next seven years before the beginning of enlargement which will transform so many things
The atmosphere surrounding the negotiations does not seem to be particularly optimistic Instead there is a vague but nonetheless real feeling of renationalisation
I only want to make a brief comment on the structural policies
You said that you believe that solidarity is a key ingredient of the European Union
Solidarity in structural terms is not something that is easily achieved but it is something that is in fact required by the single market
Will funding continue to be allocated to the structural policies
Will the Cohesion Fund be maintained
Are you going to accept the budgetary level of EUR million proposed by the Commission which many Members here consider to be a minimum
Mr President Mr President-in-Office of the Council I hope that you will reply to three questions
The Commission is proposing with Parliament support that the current Objective regions be incorporated in a new Objective region
There are excellent grounds for this as the northern geographical situation with its long distances and the fact that it is so far away from European centres puts the Objective regions in a much weaker position than many others
What progress has been made on this in the Council
There has been much forceful discussion on the issue of employment not least during the German Presidency how is this matter viewed in talks on structural policy
Will greater importance be attached to the issue of employment in the Objectives and criteria
Border area cooperation is often regarded merely as cooperation which is linked to borders
Is cross-border inter-regional cooperation now to be developed with border areas being seen as a broader cooperation issue
Mr President ladies and gentlemen I would be happy to answer the questions I have noted down questions
Do I have minutes speaking time No
So I will have to try to summarise the main subject areas and give combined answers
First all the questions relating to supposed results are pointless
So far there are none except for the two I mentioned
There is agreement on the efficiency reserve and there is agreement on the question of the consistency of national aid regions and EU aid regions
But these two agreements are also conditional on an overall agreement being reached
Let me tell you at the outset before the European Council meeting in Berlin there will be no advance agreements on any of the questions you have raised here simply because the global package has to be made up of many many components components that will bring the individual Member States advantages and disadvantages
The Member States assent is bound to depend on the overall balance the package produces for each Member State
We are talking about a lot of money for the individual states
Unfortunately the political majorities in the Council play no part at all here
During the deliberations each country naturally looks to the needs and interests of its own people and tries to reconcile them with our common European objectives
I am not counting on us being able to obtain advance results on important individual issues before Berlin because the global package has to balance out the different interests
Most of the questions in fact suggested that agreement or plans already exist on these issues
Nor has the German Presidency made any compromise proposal at all at this stage
After all our duty as the presidency is not to put all our efforts into pushing through the German point of view our duty as the presidency is first of all to sound out where the broad lines of a compromise are emerging and then when the time is ripe to propose that compromise
And that is what we will do
But at present we are still trying to narrow the options
I gave you a few examples of areas where we can already see majorities and perhaps also consensus beginning to emerge
But this process is not complete yet on any single important issue
One Member of this Parliament referred to public opinion in the Member States
That is something I take very seriously and which the German Presidency also takes very seriously
Let me just point out to you that public opinion in Europe is not united on these questions
I am well aware of public opinion in Spain
But public opinion in Germany for example is quite the opposite of what it is in Spain
The same applies elsewhere
So there is no point in telling the presidency about public opinion in a particular country
We have to concentrate on finding a solution that is acceptable to all and consistent with our European objectives
Let me confirm quite specifically that one of the objectives of Agenda and we treat it as such is to concentrate available European resources more emphatically on the objective of combating unemployment
That is one of the key objectives of the whole operation
The people of Europe see unemployment as the main challenge and expect us to do everything possible to combat it effectively
Agenda can make a major contribution towards that
I also confirm specifically that the Agenda is directly linked to the question of enlargement
I do not believe that the question of dates is really important at this moment
In any case there has never been a fixed date for the enlargement process
Neither the Council nor Parliament nor the Commission nor the applicant states ever fixed a date
Agenda also establishes the preconditions for enlargement
If we do not manage to conclude the Agenda by March that will send out a discouraging signal to the applicant countries
That is another reason why it is so important for us to conclude the Agenda in good time
In view of the conditions under which Parliament is meeting today with farmers and tractors outside on the street let me point out that agricultural policy forms one component of the global package
It is not a question of agricultural policy alone
That policy is a component of it in terms of financial volume and given the structure of our budgets it is of course the biggest component
A large majority of Member States are convinced that agricultural policy must also play its part in achieving the overall result which is to say it must also be reformed firstly in relation to compatibility with the WTO competition rules and secondly in relation to the financing of the European Union after enlargement
Since the specific question was asked let me also say quite clearly that the objective of a European agricultural policy cannot and must not be to jeopardise or even destroy farming
On the contrary the objective of European agricultural policy must be to preserve farming in all the European regions for the future
The presidency for its part is convinced that the proposals that are under discussion after all we are still only at the discussion stage do not tend in a direction that would allow us to say that farming no longer has a future in Europe
I can understand that you would like to be able to discuss concrete agreements now
But that is not possible because given the negotiating process that is under way the global package will in fact not be tied up until March
In cooperation between the presidency and Parliament we opted for a procedure that is now gathering momentum rapidly
We are meeting more and more often and are also discussing more and more subjects
We are fully aware that we need Parliament assent
During the discussions in various forums the presidency does indeed point out that when the various national positions are put forward account must be taken of the European Parliament opinion
However I must admit that some Member States take this more seriously than others
And some people seem to think we can just leave it to the presidency to decide how it will then persuade the European Parliament to agree to the results of the special summit
In any case we are endeavouring to incorporate as many as possible of Parliament views in the results of the summit
That is why I am grateful for all the ideas put forward in this debate in the form of questions
Let me assure you that we will take account of all these ideas comments and recommendations in our deliberations
Thank you Mr President-in-Office
The debate is closed
Mr President on a point of order
As a Member of Parliament who has sat through this question-and-answer session I find it particularly unsatisfactory that after a lot of statements the President-in-Office has in the end such a short period of time in which to answer about questions
A much better way to hold this sort of debate which is vital is to inject some life into it and apply the Brussels format we use to question the Commission on occasion
At present it really does not work This is a vital subject for European citizens
This has been a dead debate where few Members have been able to ask questions but even fewer have received answers
I shall bring your comments to the attention of the Bureau Mr Teverson
Situation in Kosovo
The next item is the statements by the Council and the Commission on the situation in Kosovo
I give the floor to the President-in-Office of the Council
Mr President ladies and gentlemen the contrast could hardly be more glaring While you ladies and gentlemen are discussing how the Member States of the European Union can live together more unitedly under a common European roof a few hundred kilometres away in Rambouillet the issue being discussed is whether they can live together under any kind of common roof
That shows the strategic challenge Kosovo represents for the Union
Here we have the single market and the dismantling of borders there a policy that still regards national borders as a means of fencing oneself off as a shield
In line with good diplomatic practice it was agreed that the Rambouillet negotiations would be confidential
They are to be held between the parties concerned and not publicly
So I know no more about them than you who are well-informed politicians
That is why at this point I have to confine myself to informing you that as expected the negotiations are proving difficult that so far both sides are giving no ground at all and that the mediators are currently concentrating on identifying any common areas over and above the differences
Moreover progress reports on this kind of negotiations can be very misleading for the truth is that nothing is agreed until everything is agreed
The European Union has a key role to play in the search for peace
With his preliminary work in Pristina and Belgrade the EU special envoy Mr Petritsch made a crucial contribution to enabling these negotiations to take place at all
He is now conducting the negotiations in Rambouillet together with his American colleague Mr Hill and his Russian colleague Mr Mayorski
That is a great challenge and one in which Mr Petritsch deserves our full support
Incidentally the fact that the negotiations are being conducted jointly by an American a Russian and a European shows that the European Union has now acquired a certain ability to act in the field of foreign policy too
We have certainly not reached our goal but at least we are on the right road
The European Union reacted to the conflict in Kosovo at an early stage
Since spring last year it has gradually established a differentiated system of sanctions in response to the brutal use of force by the Serbian security forces
At the same time it has allocated a substantial volume of humanitarian aid amounting of over ECU million in alone
The EU has supported the independent media to counter the propaganda from both sides
